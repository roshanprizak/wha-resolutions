WHA24.47 Problems  of the  human  environment 
The Twenty-fourth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  WHA23.60  that  requested  the  Director-General  to develop  and  submit  to the 
Twenty-fourth  World  Health  Assembly  a long-term  programme  for  environmental  health; 
Taking  into  account  the discussions  at the forty-seventh  session  of the Executive  Board  on this  subject, 
and the  resultant  resolution  EB47.R30; 
Having  examined  the  report  of the  Director-General2  prepared  in implementation  of  resolutions  WHA23.60  and  EB47.R30; 
Emphasizing  WHO's  concern  and  responsibility  with  respect  to adverse  effects  of the environment  on 
human  health,  a problem  which  should  be of central  importance  in the United  Nations  Conference  on the 
Human  Environment  to be held  in Stockholm  in June  1972; 
Taking  note  of the loss  of life  and  health  imposed  on hundreds  of millions  of people  by preventable 
diseases  that  originate  in the environment  in which  they  live; 
Stressing  the need  for the World  Health  Organization  to maintain  and  strengthen  its leading  constitutional 
role in securing  the protection  of human  health  from  adverse  environmental  factors  of the present  as well  as 
the future; 
Noting  that  one  major  difficulty  encountered  by many  Member  States  in their  efforts  to control  pollution 
of the environment  is the lack  of internationally  agreed  qualitative  and  quantitative  criteria  and  guides  to be 
embodied  in codes  of practice  for environmental  quality  that  must  be taken  into  account  in measures  for the 
protection  of people's  health; 
Recognizing  that  such  criteria,  guides  and  codes  of practice  must  be flexible  according  to local  conditions 
and be subject  to review  and  adjustment  as scientific  information  accumulates; 
Believing  none  the less  that  a degree  of harmonization  is needed  in order  to avoid  discrepancies  which 
may arise  from  decisions,  bearing  on similar  conditions,  that  give  too  much  weight  to short-term  economic 
factors  and  too  little  to considerations  of health;  and 
Believing  further  that  agreement  could  be reached  amongst  experts  on codes  of practice  which  would 
include  some  provisional  criteria  and  guides, 
1. THANKS  the Director-General,  and  ENDORSES  the report  and  proposals  submitted  for  a long-term  programme  by WHO  on the human  environment,  with  particular  emphasis  on the following  needs: 
(ia) to improve  basic  environmental  health  and  sanitation  in all countries,  and  notably  developing 
countries,  with  special  emphasis  on the provision  of adequate  quantities  of potable  water  and  the sanitary 
disposal  of wastes; 
(b) to  establish  and  to promote  international  agreement  on criteria,  guides  and  codes  of practice  with 
respect  to known  environmental  influences  on health,  with  particular  emphasis  on occupational  exposure, 
and water,  food,  air and  waste,  and  to obtain  further  information  on levels  and  trends  of these; 
(c) to  stimulate  the development  and  co-ordination  of epidemiological  health  surveillance  by methods 
including  environmental  monitoring  systems,  in collaboration  with  other  national  and  international 
efforts,  in order  to provide  basic  information  on actual  and  suspected  adverse  effects  on human  health 
attributable  to the  environment;  and 
(id) to extend  the  knowledge  of effects  of environmental  factors  on human  health  by collection  and 
dissemination  of information,  stimulation,  support  and  co-ordination  of research,  and  assistance  in the 
training  of personnel; 
2. RECOMMENDS  to Member  States  that  health  considerations  be a major  concern  of governments  in preparing 
their  contributions  for the Conference  on the Human  Environment  to be held  in Stockholm  in 1972;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to: 
(a) implement  this  programme  as fully  as possible  within  the regular  programme  of the Organization; 
(b) submit  to the  United  Nations  Conference  on the Human  Environment  to be held  in Stockholm 
in 1972  the programme  capabilities  of WHO  in the field  of the environment  on the lines  of Appendix  8 of 
the Director-General's  report1  so that  any  funds  made  available  as a result  of the  Conference  and 
allocated  to WHO  would  enable  the Organization  to carry  out the work  required  ; 
(c) report  to the  forty-ninth  session  of the  Executive  Board  and  to the  Twenty-fifth  World  Health 
Assembly  on progress  achieved,  and  any  further  financial  implications;  and 
(d) invite  voluntary  contributions  from  governments  and  other  sources  to accelerate  the pace  of effort 
and to extend  the  scope  of activities  now  being  limited  by lack  of sufficient  funds,  for example  with 
respect  to criteria  and  guides  for air and  water  quality.
