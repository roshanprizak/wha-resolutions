IMPROVING  TECHNICAL  COOPERATION  AMONG DEVELOPING  COUNTRIES  THROUGH 
IMPLEMENTATION  OF THE MEDIUM-TERM  PROGRAMME  ON TCDC FOR HEALTH FOR ALL 
1990-1995 
The Forty-third  World Health Assembly, 
Bearing in mind the resolutions  of the United Nations  General  Assembly  encouraging 
technical  cooperation  among developing  countries,  and its endorsement  of the Declaration 
and the Plan of Action of the United Nations  Conference  on Technical  Cooperation  among 
Developing  Countries,  held in Buenos Aires in 1978；  and recalling  Health Assembly 
resolutions  reaffirming  WHO's commitment  to technical  cooperation  among developing 
countries  (TCDC) as an indispensable  instrument  for health development  and for the 
implementation  of strategies  for health for all； 
Recognizing  the need for continued  improvement  of TCDC among developing  countries  as 
an indispensable  mechanism  for attaining  their self-reliance  in national  health 
development； 
Aware of the worldwide  concern  at the known management  deficiency  in national  health 
systems confirmed  by monitoring  and evaluation  of national  strategies  for health for all 
in 1985 and 1988 indicating  that inadequate  management  capacities  constitute  one of the 
key obstacles  to fulfilling  health for all and primary  health care policies； 
Recognizing  that to provide  technical  support  to the ministries  of health,  as well 
as necessary  linkages  between  policy and technical  levels,  national  networks  of 
institutions  for health development  and TCDC or equivalent  bodies are required; 
Aware of the need for developing  countries  themselves  to provide  financial  resources 
for strengthening  national  management  capacities  to facilitate  effective  and timely 
identification  of their national  needs and priorities  for health development  and TCDC； 
Further recognizing  that sustained  efforts  should be made, nationally  and 
internationally,  for the mobilization  of additional  resources  in support  of 
implementation  of health-for-all  strategies  and primary  health care, and their allocation 
to priorities  determined  in national  plans of action for health for all； 
Recognizing  with appreciation  WHO support  for the implementation  of the first 
Medium-term  Programme  on TCDC for Health for All for the period 1984-1989,  which was a 
clear expression  of developing  countries'  commitment  to the implementation  of the WHO 
Seventh General  Programme  of Work; 
Noting with satisfaction  the Declaration  of the Ninth Conference  of Heads of State 
or Government  of Non-aligned  Countries,  held in Belgrade  in 1989 as well as the adoption 
by the ministers  of health of non-aligned  and other developing  countries  of the second 
Medium-term  Programme  on TCDC for Health for All for the period 1990-1995,  an Initial 
Plan of Action on TCDC for Health for All (1990-1991),  and the Declaration  on Health as a 
Foundation  for Development,  as a contribution  by developing  countries  to the 
implementation  of health for all and primary  health care； 
1. COMMENDS  the Director-General  for the action taken to intensify  international 
technical  cooperation  for accelerated  implementation  of primary  health care in the least 
developed  and other developing  countries  facing serious  economic  difficulties  and debt 
problems； 
2. CALLS  UPON all Member States to provide  every possible  support  to the Medium-term 
Programme  on TCDC for Health for All for the period 1990-1995  and the Initial  Plan of 
Action for 1990-1991  and to any other relevant  programmes  and activities  based on TCDC, 
and especially  upon developing  countries  to make optimal  use of WHO resources, 
particularly  for carrying  out TCDC activities； 
3. URGES  developing  countries  : 
(1) to effectively  mobilize  their human and financial  resources  for the development 
and operation  of the networks  of national  institutions  for health development  and 
TCDC ； 
(2) to encourage  relevant  national  institutions  to strengthen  their TCDC function 
and capacities  and to act as clearing  houses for information  on national  needs and 
priorities  with respect  to the development  and implementation  of national  strategies 
for health for all, particularly  those needs that are amenable  to TCDC, and provide 
them with the financial  resources  required; 
(3) to facilitate  the identification  of suitable  institutions  for health 
development  and TCDC, in close collaboration  with WHO, for intensified  technical 
cooperation  at the intercountry  or regional  levels leading  to the initiation  of the 
international  resource  network  development  for carrying  out specific  technical 
cooperation  in support  of the implementation  of the Medium-term  Programme  on TCDC 
for Health for All for the period 1990-1995,  by, in the first instance,  formulating 
and implementing  concrete  TCDC activities  for the period 1990-1991  along the lines 
contained  in the Initial  Plan of Action; 
(4) to request,  as feasible  and appropriate,  the existing  institutions  for health 
development  and TCDC to assist the initiation  and strengthening  of similar 
institutions  at the national,  subregional,  regional,  and international  levels；

support for the implementation  of TCDC activities； 
4. CALLS  UPON the developed  countries  to intensify  their support  to the developing 
countries,  particularly  the least developed  among them, for accelerated  implementation 
of health for all through  primary  health care, by providing  financial  resources  through 
bilateral  and multilateral  channels,  including  WHO, for effective  implementation  of 
health development  programmes  and expresses  the hope that the forthcoming  conference  on 
assistance  to the least developed  countries  will enable greater  priority  to be given to 
the health sector in the context  of development  aid; 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to give priority  to the implementation  of the resolutions  of the Health 
Assembly  concerning  TCDC and to organize  effective  coordination  of WHO's programmes 
and activities  in support  of TCDC for Health for All；

subregion  those to be entrusted  with the function  of regional  and/or subregional

countries,  individually  and collectively,  to develop  new approaches  for enhancing 
international  technical  cooperation  among themselves,  with developed  countries  and 
with WHO and other United Nations,  international  and bilateral  agencies  for more 
effective  implementation  of primary  health care；

global levels；
