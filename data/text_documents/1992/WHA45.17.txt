FORTY-FIFTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA45.17 
Agenda  item  18 13  May 1992 
IMMUNIZATION  AND  VACCINE  QUALITY 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  the report  of the Director-General  on the Expanded  Programme  on Immunization,  particularly 
the goals  and operational  targets  set for the 1990s,  and the report  on vaccine  quality;1 
Commending  Member  States  for their  achievement  in reaching  80% coverage  of the world's  children  in 
the first year of life and in preventing  each year an estimated  3.2 million  deaths  of children  in the developing 
world  from  measles,  neonatal  tetanus  and pertussis,  and over 400 000 cases  of paralytic  poliomyelitis; 
Applauding  the virtual  achievement  in the Region  of the Americas  of the goal of poliomyelitis 
eradication  and the vigorous  pursuit  of the elimination  of neonatal  tetanus  and reduction  or elimination  of 
measles  in that Region; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA41.28,  WHA42.32  and WHA44.33  and the World  Declaration  on the Survival, 
Protection  and Development  of Children,  which  set goals  for the 1990s:  90%  immunization  coverage;  a 
dramatic  reduction  in measles  cases  and deaths  as a step towards  measles  eradication;  the elimination  of 
neonatal  tetanus;  and the eradication  of poliomyelitis; 
Recalling  resolution  WHA35.31,  which  urges  Member  States  to take action  with respect  to the use of 
only those  vaccines  meeting  WHO  requirements,  and resolution  WHA42.32  endorsing  the plan of action  for 
the global  eradication  of poliomyelitis,  which  calls for the universal  use by the end of 1990  of poliomyelitis 
vaccines  meeting  WHO  requirements; 
Aware  that additional  quantities  of vaccines  will be needed,  and that difficulties  in supply  and 
procurement  of sufficient  quantities  of vaccines  of high quality  are increasing  the reliance  on local  manufacture 
and on additional  funds  for vaccine  purchase,  especially  for the supply  of poliomyelitis  vaccine; 
Aware  that the Global  Advisory  Group  has set operational  targets  for the introduction  of hepatitis  В 
vaccine  in immunization  programmes  and that these  targets  are consistent  with those  recommended  by the 
International  Conference  on the Control  of Hepatitis  В in Developing  Countries  held in Yaoundé  in October 
1991; 
Recognizing  that if the goals  and targets  set for the 1990s  are to be achieved  it is essential  that the 
recommended  strategies  of the Expanded  Programme  on Immunization  should  be implemented  and that 
additional  financial  and technical  support  should  be made  available  as rapidly  as possible  at national,  regional 
and global  levels,

1. ENDORSES  the goals  and operational  targets  for the 1990s  outlined  in the report  of the 
Director-General  on the Expanded  Programme,  and the plan for the assurance  of vaccine  quality,  including 
steps to establish  or strengthen  national  control  authorities  in Member  States; 
2. APPRECIATES  the support  from  UNICEF  and other  organizations  of the United  Nations  system,  other 
intergovernmental  agencies,  and governmental  and nongovernmental  organizations,  including  Rotary 
International,  and individuals  that are working  together,  especially  in the least developed  countries,  for a world 
free from  vaccine-preventable  diseases; 
3. URGES  Member  States: 
(1) to accelerate  activities  and commit  all necessary  resources  to achieve  the goals  and operational 
targets  for immunization  set for the 1990s  in ways  that strengthen  primary  health  care and as a high 
priority  in their  health  plans; 
(2) to use only vaccines  that meet  WHO  requirements  in their  immunization  programmes  and to 
include  this requirement  as part of their immunization  plans; 
(3) to ensure  the proper  functioning  of a cold chain  and logistics  system  to maintain  vaccine  potency 
until the time of use; 
(4) to strengthen  the system  for epidemiological  surveillance  of EPI target  diseases  and other  high 
priority  diseases; 
(5) to integrate  cost-effective  new vaccines,  such as hepatitis  В vaccine,  into national  immunization 
programmes  in countries  where  it is feasible; 
4. CALLS  on organizations  of the United  Nations  system,  other  intergovernmental  agencies,  and 
governmental  and nongovernmental  organizations  to support  the achievement  of these  goals  and operational 
targets  for immunization  for the 1990s,  to promote  efforts  to ensure  the universal  use of vaccines  meeting 
WHO  requirements,  and to participate  in initiatives  with donors  to ensure  the increased  financial  support 
necessary  to meet  both current  and future  vaccine  needs; 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to implement  the action  necessary  to meet  the goals  and targets  of the Expanded  Programme  on 
Immunization  set for the 1990s; 
(2) to obtain,  as an initial  step in assuring  the quality  of the vaccines  used in the Expanded  Programme 
on Immunization,  information  from  national  authorities  of countries  producing  vaccines  as to the 
implementation  of the WHO  guiding  principles  for regulatory  authorities  as recommended  by the WHO 
Expert  Committee  on Biological  Standardization; 
(3) to obtain  information  from  countries  importing  vaccine,  either  in bulk or in final containers,  on 
whether  the national  authority  has certified  that such vaccine  and its manufacturer  comply  with the 
national  and WHO  requirements  for manufacturing  and control  procedures  to assure  the quality  of 
vaccines; 
(4) to continue  to obtain  broad  commitment  and mobilize  support,  including  financing  from  a wide 
variety  of sources,  for vaccine  procurement  and quality  assurance; 
(5) to strengthen  financial  mechanisms  that would  permit  the rapid  integration  of cost-effective  new 
vaccines  into national  immunization  programmes;

(6) to keep  the Health  Assembly  informed  through  the Executive  Board  of the progress  in achieving 
the immunization  goals  and targets  set for the 1990s,  and of efforts  to provide  sufficient  poliomyelitis 
vaccine  for the global  eradication  initiative  and to ensure  the establishment  of infrastructure  in countries 
for quality  assurance  for tetanus  toxoid  and poliomyelitis  vaccine.
