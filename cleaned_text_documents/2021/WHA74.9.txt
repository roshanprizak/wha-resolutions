Having considered the report on the global technical strategy and targets for malaria 20162030;2 Recalling resolutions WHA58.2 (2005) on malaria control, WHA60.18 (2007) and WHA64.17 (2011) on malaria, including the proposal for establishment of World Malaria Day, and United Nations General Assembly resolution 69/325 (2015) on consolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control and eliminate malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa, by 2015 and beyond, and resolutions 70/300 (2016), 71/325 (2017), 72/309 (2018), 73/337 (2019) and 74/305 (2020) on consolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control and eliminate malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa, by 2030 and resolution WHA68.2 (2015) on the global technical strategy and targets for malaria 20162030; Noting the report of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group on Malaria Eradication entitled Malaria eradication: benefits, future scenarios and feasibility; Noting with concern that two of the four global technical strategy for malaria 20162030 milestones for 2020 were not met, as reported in the World malaria report 2020, as the world has not been successful in reducing malaria mortality rates globally by 40% or in reducing malaria case incidence globally by 40%, compared with 2015 baselines, while welcoming the realization of country-level milestones on achieving national elimination in 10 countries and preventing re-establishment of malaria in all countries that were malaria free; Recognizing that sustainable, equitable malaria control requires resilient health systems and the achievement of universal health coverage, and that the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and other recent past epidemics have negatively affected health systems functioning and the production and delivery of life-saving malaria interventions in environments safe for both health workers and communities; Taking into account the 1955 resolution WHA8.30 on malaria eradication, in which the Eighth World Health Assembly decided that the World Health Organization should take the initiative, provide technical advice, and encourage research and co-ordination of resources in the implementation of a programme having as its ultimate objective the world-wide eradication of malaria and acknowledging the 2016 African Unions Catalytic framework to end AIDS, TB and eliminate malaria in Africa by 2030 and the 2015 East Asia Summit commitment to eliminate malaria across Asia Pacific, 1. RECOMMITS to the goal of malaria eradication and affirms that this goal will be incorporated into the post-2030 iteration of the global technical strategy for malaria; 2. ADOPTS the updated global technical strategy for malaria 20162030 which emphasizes country ownership and promotes equitable and resilient health systems to deliver quality services, which are adaptive to local situations and which recognizes the need for capacity-strengthening so that countries can generate, analyse and use high-quality data, including surveillance data, for making decisions and tailoring responses to leave no one behind so that countries can improve the effectiveness and quality of health services, introducing additional highly effective interventions into the existing 1 See Annex 4 for the financial and administrative implications for the Secretariat of this resolution. 2 Document A74/55. 3 Global technical strategy for malaria 20162030, 2021 update.

RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 39 package where this is cost-effective and aligned with country priorities; and better addressing the wider determinants that potentially disrupt or facilitate the reach and quality of services, particularly for women and children under 5 years of age; 3. URGES Member States:1 (1) to accelerate the pace of implementation, according to national contexts and priorities and their malaria strategies and operational plans consistent with the updated framework and principles of the global technical strategy for malaria 20162030 and the WHO Guidelines for malaria; (2) to extend investment in and support to health services, including integrated, accessible, affordable and quality prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment including through the use of technology-based solutions at facility and community levels ensuring no one is left behind, including to improve access for the most rural remote and marginalized populations that have the lowest access and coverage of interventions; (3) to sustain and scale up as appropriate, sufficient funding of the global response against malaria; (4) to extend investment in the development of new tools and support for implementation research and innovation to enable efficient delivery and equitable access with a view to maximizing impact and costeffectiveness; 4. URGES international, regional and national partners from within and beyond the health sector, in particular those in the Roll Back Malaria Partnership to End Malaria, to strengthen their support for and further engage in implementation of the global technical strategy for malaria 20162030 update and align this with existing health strategies and plans; 5. REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to continue to provide technical support and guidance to Member States1 for the national adaptation, implementation and operationalization of the updated global technical strategy for malaria 20162030; (2) to update regularly technical guidance on malaria prevention, care and control and elimination, as new evidence is gathered and innovative tools and approaches become available and support countries to adopt and implement this guidance effectively; (3) to monitor the implementation of the updated global technical strategy for malaria 20162030 and evaluate its impact in terms of progress towards set milestones and targets; (4) to work with Member States civil society and other partners to increase investment in and efforts towards research to optimize current tools, develop and validate new, safe and affordable malaria-related medicines, products and technologies, including the R&D blueprint, and foster the generation, translation and dissemination of normative, technical and operational guidance; 1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations. 40 SEVENTY-FOURTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY (5) to submit a status report to the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in 2024, and a full progress report to the Seventy-ninth World Health Assembly in 2026, followed by a final status report to the Eighty-first World Health Assembly in 2028.
