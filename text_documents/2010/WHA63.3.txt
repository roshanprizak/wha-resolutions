Agenda item 11.8 20 May 2010 
Advancing food safety initiatives 
 
The Sixty-third World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on food safety,1 
Recalling resolution WHA53.15 on food safety, whic h requested the Director-General to put in 
place a global strategy for the surveillance of foodbor ne diseases and for the efficient gathering and 
exchange of information in and between countries; 
Recalling resolution WHA55.16 on the global pub lic health response to  natural occurrence, 
accidental release or deliberate use of biological and chemical agents or radionuclear material that 
affect health, which noted that such agents can be disseminated through food- and water-supply 
chains; 
Noting the endorsement by the Executive Board in 2002 of WHO’s global strategy for food 
safety,2 which had as its aim the reduction of the hea lth and social burden of foodborne disease; 
Noting also, that other food safety-related ac tivities identified in resolutions WHA53.15 and 
WHA55.16 have been undertaken, including: the revi sion of the International Health Regulations in 
2005; the establishment of the International Food Safety Authorities Network in 2005; the 
establishment of WHO’s Foodborne Disease Burden  Epidemiology Reference Group in 2006; and 
increased participation, particularly by developing countries, in the elaboration of international food 
safety standards by the Codex Alimentarius Commission; 
Recognizing that the Codex Alimentarius Commission presents a unique opportunity for all 
countries to join the international community in formulating and harmonizing food standards and ensuring their global implementation, and in particular  the participation of developing countries in this 
regard should be encouraged; 
Further recognizing the important roles of WHO and FAO in support of the Codex Alimentarius 
Commission as the international reference point for developments associated with food standards; 
Confirming that foodborne disease continues to represent a serious threat to the health of 
millions of people in the world, particularly tho se in developing countries with poor nutritional status;

2 Mindful of the inextricable links between food safety, nutrition and food security, and 
acknowledging the instrumental role of food safet y in eradicating hunger and malnutrition, in 
particular in low-income and food-deficit countries; 
Aware of increasing evidence that many communi cable diseases, including emerging zoonoses, 
are transmitted through food, and that exposure to  chemicals and pathogens in the food supply is 
associated with acute and chronic diseases; 
Acknowledging that climate change could be a fact or in the increasing rates of some foodborne 
diseases, including those of zoonotic origin, owing to the more rapid growth of microorganisms in 
food and water with higher temperatures, resulting in  the emergence of toxins in new geographical 
areas and possibly in higher levels of toxins or pathogens in food; 
Recognizing that the global trade in food is increasing every year, contributing to the risk of 
spread of pathogens and contaminants across na tional borders, thereby creating new challenges for 
food authorities and necessitating more efficient global  sharing of food safety information, taking into 
account that protection of food safety cannot lead to  discrimination or a disguised restriction on 
international trade; 
Acknowledging the continuing need for closer colla boration between the health sector and other 
sectors, and increased action on food safety at the international and national levels, across the full 
length of the food-production chain, in order to reduce significantly the incidence of foodborne disease; 
Noting the continuing need for updated and compre hensive internationally agreed standards and 
agreements for risk assessments and scientific ad vice to support measures and interventions to 
improve the safety and nutritional quality of food; 
Recognizing the importance of international ag reement on global management of food safety, 
the application of scientific principles in finding solutions, the efficient exchange of monitoring and 
surveillance data, and practical experience, 
1. URGES Member States:
1 
(1) to continue to establish and maintain the activities and measures elaborated in resolutions 
WHA53.15 on food safety and WHA55.16 on the global public health response to natural 
occurrence, accidental release or deliberate use of biological and chemical agents or 
radionuclear material that affect health; 
(2) to further develop and implement the co re capacities as defined in Annex 1 of the 
International Health Regulations (2005), as app licable, and those required for participation in 
the International Food Safety Authorities Network,  specifically for food-safety events, including 
the development of systems for: surveillance fo r foodborne disease and food contamination; risk 
assessment, traceability, risk mana gement, including the Hazard An alysis and Critical Control 
Points system, and risk communication; food safety emergency response; product tracing and 
recall; and strengthened laboratory capacity; 
                                                      
1 And, where applicable , regional economic inte gration organizations.   WHA63.3 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  (3) to participate fully as members of the In ternational Food Safety Authorities Network in 
its activities, including supporting the timely tr ansmission of data, information and knowledge 
about food-safety emergencies through the Network in a transparent manner; 
(4) to enhance the integration of food-safety considerations into food aid, food security and 
nutrition interventions in order to reduce the occurrence of foodborne diseases and improve the 
health outcomes of populations in particular the vulnerable groups; 
(5) to establish or improve the evidence base for food safety through systematic efforts on
