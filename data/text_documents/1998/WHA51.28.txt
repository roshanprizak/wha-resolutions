The Fifty-first World Health Assembly,
Having considered the report of the Director-General on strategy for sanitation in high-risk communities;Aware of the plight of rural and urban communities with highly insanitary conditions, the importance of
sanitation for health in general and in reducing the incidence and spread of infectious diseases, and theresponsibility that WHO has to provide appropriate leadership;
Concerned about the vast and increasing number of people in the world who lack sanitation, living in
communities that should receive the highest priority for sanitation because of the particularly high risk of diseaserelated to insanitary conditions;
Recognizing that while full coverage by water supply and sanitation services as proclaimed by the 1990
World Summit for Children and in other forums remains the ultimate goal, higher priority should be given tothese high-risk communities without delay;
Recalling resolutions WHA39.20, WHA42.25, WHA44.27, WHA44.28, WHA45.31 and WHA46.20 which
inter alia have guided WHO’s programme on community water supply and sanitation;
Recalling that the Executive Board established environmental health, particularly water supply and
sanitation, as one of the priority areas for WHO;
Noting that a joint water supply and environmental sanitation strategy was approved by the UNICEF/WHO
Joint Committee on Health Policy in May 1997;
Noting that the topic of water, including community water supply and sanitation, is to be considered by the
United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development in 1998, which will determine future priorities, actionand roles in this area;
Exploring new and innovative financing mechanisms for sanitation, including community financing, private
sector funding and private management of public assets,

high-risk areas, including the review of cases and establishment of models of “good practice”;
(5) to support training of extension workers in methodology for involving communities in their sanitation

(6) to integrate sanitation with action such as “Healthy cities/islands/villages/marketplaces” projects and
