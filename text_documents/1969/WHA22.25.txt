WHA22.25  Extension  of the Agreement  with  the United  Nations  Relief  and  Works  Agency  for Palestine  Refugees 
in the Near  East 
The Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that,  on 29 September  1950,  an agreement  was  concluded  between  the  Director-General 
of the  World  Health  Organization  and  the  Director  of the  United  Nations  Relief  and  Works  Agency  for 
Palestine  Refugees  in the  Near  East  (UNRWA)  on the  basis  of principles  established  by the  Third  World 
Health  Assembly; 
Considering  that  the Nineteenth  World  Health  Assembly,  in resolution  WHA19.25,  extended  the duration 
of this  agreement  until  30 June  1969  and  that,  subsequently,  the  General  Assembly  of the United  Nations, 
at its twenty-third  session,  extended  the mandate  of UNRWA  until  30 June  1972; 
Considering  that,  on numerous  occasions,  the  World  Health  Assembly  has  extended  the  duration  of 
this agreement  to coincide  with  the respective  periods  of extension  of the mandate  of UNRWA;  and 
Considering  that  the World  Health  Organization  should  continue  the technical  direction  of the health 
programme  administered  by UNRWA, 
1. AUTHORIZES  the  Director-General  to extend  the  agreement  with  UNRWA  from  time  to time  for such 
periods  as UNRWA  continues  to have  a mandate  from  the United  Nations;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to report  to the  Health  Assembly  if he should  feel  that  the  necessity 
for continuing  this  agreement  on the  same  basis  no longer  obtains.
