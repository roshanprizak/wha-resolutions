WHA28.53  Schistosomiasis 
The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  EB5.R5  and  EB55.R22  on schistosomiasis; 
Noting  that  the  disease  remains  largely  uncontrolled  and  that  its prevalence  is increasing,  and  that 
water  development  projects  designed  to improve  needed  agricultural  production  and  to improve  needed 
economic  conditions  undertaken  without  consideration  given  to preventive  health  measures  may  contribute 
to this  increase; 
Noting  the  increasing  evidence  of the possible  occurrence  of serious  complications  and  sequelae  as a 
result  of schistosomiasis  infection; 
Noting  further  that  the World  Food  Conference  emphasized  the  need  for greatly  increased  food  production  and  noted  that  meeting  nutritional  and  other  requirements  of the world's  expanding  population  will 
require  more  projects  to impound  water  and  irrigate  fields; 
Expressing  the view  that  proper  engineering  design  of water  management  projects  can have  considerable 
importance  in limiting  the spread  of schistosomiasis  among  populations  affected  by such  projects; 
Noting  the inclusion  of schistosomiasis  within  the coordinated  biomedical  research  programme  of the 
Organization; 
Recognizing  that  effective  planning  for,  and  operation  of, schistosomiasis  control  activities  requires  close 
cooperation  and  coordination  among  agencies  within  the United  Nations  system,  the international  financial 
community  and  ministries  within  national  governments  under  the leadership  of the  World  Health  Organization; 
Expressing  appreciation  for  the report  of the Director-General  which  outlines  the  complexity  of the 
problems  involved  to prove  the feasibility  of schistosomiasis  control; 
Looking  forward  to the important  international  meeting  on schistosomiasis  which  is scheduled  to be 
held in Cairo  in October  1975;  and 
Recognizing  the  very  high  costs  of implementation  of control  programmes  using  present  available 
methods, 
REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to prepare  and  keep  guidelines  current  on the development  of water  management  projects,  including 
engineering  specifications,  to minimize  the possibility  of the spread  of schistosomiasis  and  other  waterborne  disease  in water  management  projects; 
(2) to advise  countries  and  donor  organizations  on the application  of guidelines  on water  development, 
including  hydroelectric,  projects  planned,  under  construction,  or completed  ； 
(3) to request  Members  to make  available  information  on schistosomiasis  control  programmes  under 
way or carried  out  in their  countries,  including  details  of research  work,  manpower  development  programmes,  costs,  etc.; 
(4) to seek  extrabudgetary  support  and  assistance  from  various  sources  within  the  United  Nations 
system  and  international  and  private  agencies  in order  to provide  assistance  to governments 
(a) in planning  and  carrying  out  studies  of the epidemiology  of the disease,  the cost/effectiveness 
of alternative  methods  of control,  and  its social  and  economic  impact, 
(b) in the preparation  and  implementation  of control  programmes; 
(5) to stimulate  increased  efforts  in research  in drug  development,  chemotherapy,  epidemiology,  control 
including  methodologies  for self-help,  and  immunological  aspects  of schistosomiasis; 
(6) to draw  the  attention  of Member  States  where  the  disease  is not  endemic  to the  desirability  of 
organizing  epidemiological  surveillance  within  health  services  ； and 
(7) to report  on this  matter  to the Twenty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly.
