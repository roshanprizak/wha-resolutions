WHA26.57  Urgent  need  for suspension  of testing  of nuclear  weapons 
The Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Conscious  of the potentially  harmful  consequences  for the health  of present  and  succeeding  generations 
from  any  contamination  of the environment  resulting  from  nuclear  weapons  testing; 
Recognizing  that  fall-out  from  nuclear  weapons  tests  is an uncontrolled  and  unjustified  addition  to 
the radiation  hazards  to which  mankind  is exposed  ； 
Expressing  serious  concern  that  nuclear  weapons  testing  in the atmosphere  has  continued  in disregard 
of the spirit  of the treaty  banning  nuclear  weapons  tests  in the atmosphere,  in outer  space  and  under  water  ； 
Recalling  the Constitution  of the World  Health  Organization  and  in particular  the following  principles  : 
(1) that  the  enjoyment  of the  highest  attainable  standard  of health  is one  of the  fundamental  rights 
of every  human  being  without  distinction  of race,  religion,  political  belief,  economic  and  social  conditions, 
and 
(2) that  the health  of all peoples  is fundamental  to the attainment  of peace  and  security  and  is dependent 
upon  the  fullest  cooperation  of individuals  and  States; 
Conscious  also  of the special  responsibility  of members  of the United  Nations  family  of organizations 
to express  their  concern,  in the areas  coming  within  their  respective  competences,  about  the implications  for 
present  and  future  generations  of mankind  of continued  nuclear  weapons  testing; 
Further  recalling  that  the World  Health  Assembly  in resolution  WHA19.39  of May  1966  called  upon 
all countries  to cooperate  in preventing  an increase  in the level  of background  radiation  in the interests  of 
the health  of the present  and  future  generations  of mankind; 
Noting  with  regret  that  all States  have  not  yet adhered  to the treaty  banning  nuclear  weapons  tests  in 
the atmosphere,  in outer  space  and  under  water,  signed  in Moscow  on 5 August  1963; 
Further  recalling  resolution  2934  A-C  (XXVII)  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly  of 29 November 
1972  and Principle  No.  26 of the Declaration  of the United  Nations  Conference  on the Human  Environment 
that man  and  his environment  must  be spared  the  effects  of nuclear  weapons  and  all other  means  of mass 
destruction  ； 
Further  noting  that  certain  Member  States  of the  World  Health  Organization  have  in several  fora 
expressed  their  overwhelming  opposition  to nuclear  weapons  testing,  and  especially  to testing  which  exposed 
their  peoples  to radioactive  fall-out; 
Further  noting  and  endorsing  the views  expressed  by such  bodies  as the United  Nations  Scientific  Committee  on the  Effects  of Atomic  Radiation  and  the  International  Commission  on Radiological  Protection 
that any  avoidable  increase  in the level  of ionizing  radiation  in the atmosphere  is unjustifiable  and constitutes 
a potential  long-term  danger  to health, 
1. EXPRESSES  its deep  concern  at the threat  to the health  of present  and  future  generations  and  at the damage 
to the human  environment  which  might  be expected  from  any  increase  in the level  of ionizing  radiation  in 
the atmosphere; 
2. DEPLORES  therefore  all nuclear  weapons  testing  which  results  in such  an increase  in the level  of ionizing 
radiation  in the atmosphere  and  urges  its immediate  cessation; 
3. INVITES  the Director-General  of the World  Health  Organization  to bring  this  resolution  to the attention 
of the Secretary-General  of the United  Nations  with  a request  that  he inform  all Member  States  of the United 
Nations  of its contents.
