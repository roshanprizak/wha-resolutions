Agenda item 11.12 21 May 2010 
Viral hepatitis 
 
The Sixty-third World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on viral hepatitis;1 
Taking into account the fact that some 2000 million people have been infected by hepatitis B 
virus and that about 350 million people live with a chronic form of the disease; 
Considering that hepatitis C is still not preventable by vaccination and around 80% of 
hepatitis C virus infections become a chronic infection; 
Considering the seriousness of viral hepatitis as a global public health problem and the need for 
advocacy to governments, all pa rties and populations for acti on on health promotion, disease 
prevention, diagnosis and treatment; 
Expressing concern at the lack of progress in th e prevention and control of viral hepatitis in 
developing countries, in particular  in sub-Saharan Africa, due to the lack of access to affordable, 
appropriate treatment and care  as well as an integrated approach to the prevention and control 
measures of the disease;  
Considering the need for a global approach to a ll forms of viral hepatitis – with a special focus 
on viral hepatitis B and C, which ha ve the higher rates of morbidity; 
Recalling that one route of transmission of hepa titis B and C viruses is parenteral and that the 
Health Assembly in resolution WHA28.72 on utilization and supply of human blood and blood 
products recommended the developm ent of national public servi ces for blood donation and in 
resolution WHA58.13 agreed to the establishment of an annual World Blood Donor Day, and that in 
both resolutions the Health Asse mbly recognized the need for safe blood to be available to blood 
recipients; 
Reaffirming resolution WHA45.17 on immunizatio n and vaccine quality which urged Member 
States to include hepatitis B vaccines in national immunization programmes; 
Considering the need to reduce liver cancer mortality rates and that viral hepatitides are 
responsible for 78% of cases of primary liver cancer;

2 Considering the collaborative linkages between  prevention and control measures for viral 
hepatitis and those for infectious diseases like HI V and other related sexually transmitted and 
bloodborne infections; 
Recognizing the need to reduce incidence to pr event and control viral hepatitis, to increase 
access to correct diagnosis and to provide appr opriate treatment programmes in all regions; 
Further recognizing the need fo r universal coverage for safe injection practices as promoted 
through the WHO Safe Injection Global Network, 
1. RESOLVES that 28 July or such other day or days as individual Member States decide shall be 
designated as World Hepatitis Day in order to provi de an opportunity for education and greater 
understanding of viral hepatitis as a global public health problem, and to  stimulate the strengthening of 
preventive and control measures of this disease in Member States; 
2. URGES Member States: 
(1) to implement and/or improve epidemiol ogical surveillance systems and to strengthen 
laboratory capacity, where necessary, in order to  generate reliable information for guiding 
prevention and control measures; 
(2) to support or enable an integrated and cost -effective approach to the prevention, control 
and management of viral hepatitis considering th e linkages with associated  coinfection such as 
HIV through multisectoral collaboration amon g health and educa tional institutions, 
nongovernmental organizations and civil society, including measures that strengthen safety and quality and the regulation of blood products; 
(3) to incorporate in their specific contexts the policies, strategies and tools recommended by 
WHO in order to define and implement pr eventive actions, diagnostic measures and the 
provision of assistance to the population aff ected by viral hepatitis including migrant and 
vulnerable populations; 
(4) to strengthen national health systems in or der to address prevention and control of viral 
hepatitis effectively through the provision of health promotion and national surveillance, 
including tools for prevention, diagnosis a nd treatment of viral hepatitis, vaccination, 
information, communication and injection safety; 
(5) to provide vaccination strategies, infecti on-control measures, and means for injection 
safety for health-care workers; 
(6) to use national and international resources, e ither human or financial, to provide technical 
support to strengthen health systems in order to provide local populations adequately with the 
most cost-effective and affordable interventions  that suit the needs of local epidemiological 
situations;   WHA63.18 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  (7) to consider, as necessary, national legisla tive mechanisms for the use of the flexibilities 
contained in the Agreement on Trade-Related Asp ects of Intellectual Property Rights in order to 
promote access to specific pharmaceutical products;1 
(8) to consider, whenever necessary, using ex isting administrative and legal means in order 
to promote access to preventive, diagnostic a nd treatment technologies against viral hepatitis; 
(9) to develop and implement monitoring and evaluation tools in order to assess progress 
towards reducing the burden from viral hepatitis a nd to guide evidence-based strategy for policy 
decisions related to preventive, diagnostic and treatment activities; 
(10) to promote the observance of 28 July each year, or on such other day or days as 
individual Member States may decide, as World Hepatitis Day; 
(11) to promote total injection safety at all levels of national health-care system; 
3. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to establish in collaboration with Member  States the necessary guidelines, strategies,  
time-bound goals and tools for the surveillance,  prevention and control of viral hepatitis; 
(2) to provide the necessary support to the deve lopment of scientific research related to the 
prevention, diagnosis and tr eatment of viral hepatitis; 
(3) to improve the assessment of global and regional  economic impact and estimate the 
burden of viral hepatitis;   
(4) to support, as appropriate, resource-constr ained Member States in conducting events to 
mark World Hepatitis Day; 
(5) to invite international organizations, fina ncial institutions and other partners to give 
support and assign resources in strengthening of su rveillance systems, prevention and control 
programme, diagnostic and laboratory capacity , and management of viral hepatitis to 
developing countries in an equitable, most efficient, and suitable manner;  
(6) to strengthen the WHO Safe Injection Global Network; 
(7) to collaborate with other organizations  in the United Nations system, partners, 
international organizations and other relevant stakeholders in  enhancing access to affordable 
treatments in developing countries;
