The Fourteenth World Health Assembly, Considering that it is necessary to make the maximum and most rational use of the resources placed at the disposal of the world malaria eradication programme, so as to achieve final success as soon as possible; Noting that the Fourteenth World Health Assembly has approved the gradual incorporation of provision for all malaria activities in the regular budget of the Organization, as from 1962; 1 Noting that this fact signifies that a further effort will be made by the majority of countries which will have repercussions on their economy, and that it should be counterbalanced by the guarantee that these funds will be used in the most rational manner, inaccordance with a programme based on the contributions voted; and Noting that many countries have made satisfactory progress in their programmes, having trained their technical personnel, who have thus acquired adequate experience in carrying out the programmes, 1. REQUESTS the Director-General to prepare estimates of the trends in the activities of the Organization in respect of malaria for the coming five years, which will make it possible to visualize the future clearly; and 2. RECOMMENDS that in countries whose programmes are making satisfactory progress and which have sufficient trained personnel, the possibility of reducing technical advisory assistance be studied by the respective regional committees for the benefit of those whose programmes have not yet started or are in their initial stages, aswell as in order to make available equipment and supplies, particularly drugs, for use in the consolidation stages.
