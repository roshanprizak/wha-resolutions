Having considered the report2 on the WHO global plan of action to strengthen the role of the health system within a national multisectoral response to address interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children;3 Recalling that all children have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; Also recalling that all children should be free from violence, and resolution WHA49.25 (1996) on prevention of violence, which declared violence a leading worldwide public health problem, resolution WHA56.24 (2003) on implementing the recommendations of the World report on violence and health, resolution WHA61.16 (2008) on female genital mutilation, and resolution WHA67.15 1 See Annex 4 for the financial and administrative implications for the Secretariat of this resolution. 2 Document A74/21. 3 Children are classed as all persons under 18 years of age. 64 SEVENTY-FOURTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY (2014) on strengthening the role of the health system in addressing violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children; Cognizant of efforts across the United Nations system to address the challenge of violence against children including through the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as applicable, its optional protocols and its committee, the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and specifically target 16.2 of the Sustainable Development Goals (End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children) and other relevant targets of the Goals, and mindful of the importance of multisectoral engagement and collaboration in preventing and responding to violence against children; Noting that violence is defined by WHO as the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation; 1 Recalling resolution WHA67.15 (2014) on strengthening the role of the health system in addressing violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children, which noted that interpersonal violence, distinguished from self-inflicted violence and collective violence, is divided into family and partner violence and community violence, and includes forms of violence throughout the life course, such as child abuse, partner violence, abuse of elderly people, violence between family members, youth violence, random acts of violence, rape or sexual assault, and violence in institutional settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes; Also noting that violence against children involves all forms of violence against people under 18 years old, and includes, but is not limited to, child maltreatment involving physical, sexual and psychological violence, and neglect of children by parents, caregivers and other authority figures, bullying (including cyberbullying) at the hands of other children, sexual violence including rape, sexual trafficking, online exploitation and non-contact violence such as sexual harassment, and psychological violence such as denigration, threats and intimidation, and other non-physical forms of hostile treatment;1 and further noting concern over harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation; Deeply concerned that each year violence affects an estimated one billion children, with many early, acute and lifelong, intergenerational consequences on physical and mental health, risk-taking behaviours and overall quality of life, including mental health conditions, physical injuries, impairments and death; Recognizing that violence against women and girls, and against children, is a violation of human rights that further exacerbates gender inequalities by exposing individuals to heightened risk of violent behaviour and an increased risk of being subjected to violence at a later stage in life, and that ending violence against children is essential to the long-term prevention of violence; Also recognizing that exposure to a mothers abuse by a partner has similar mental and physical health impacts on children to maltreatment, and that violence against children and against women can occur in the same households, and that it is therefore critical to address the intersections of these two 1 Krug EG, Dahlberg LL, Mercy JA, Zwi AB, Lozano R, editors. World report on violence and health. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2002. 2 Violence against children [factsheet]. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2020 accessed 7 July 2021). RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 65 forms of violence and eliminate common risk factors, as a prerequisite to long-term prevention of violence against women and violence against children; Further recognizing that over the course of their lifetime, children exposed to all forms of violence are at increased risk of delayed cognitive development, mental health conditions, high-risk and health-harming behaviours, and further interpersonal and self-directed violence, and that as a result of these they are more likely to be affected by noncommunicable diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, reproductive health problems and other negative social consequences including educational under-attainment; Noting that violence against children costs the world economy between US$ 1.49 trillion and US$ 6.9 trillion annually, that many of the economic costs fall to the health sector as it provides treatment for the acute and long-term consequences, and that this likely represents an underestimation of the full costs of violence against children since it does not consider the long-term impacts on future human capital formation of children exposed to violence; Also noting with concern that the growing economic and financial burden aggravated by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will further exacerbate inequalities, increase poverty and hunger, and reverse the hard-won developmental gains, including in the health sector; Further noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered significant new needs and magnified pre-existing inequalities and vulnerabilities, leading to an increased risk of violence involving children and women, and increases in harmful practices and crimes resulting from, inter alia, closures of schools and protective services, increased isolation, emotional and economic burden on households, and mental health conditions, which threaten multiple aspects of childrens physical, psychological, sexual and reproductive health; Recognizing that state institutions can also be sites of violence, including violence in schools perpetrated by teachers and peers, noting that children face various forms of online violence as well as violence facilitated by information and communications technology (ICT), and that online and ICT-facilitated violence is disproportionately affecting women and girls; Concerned about the occurrence of bullying, both online and offline, in all parts of the world and the fact that children who are victimized by such practices may be at heightened risk of compromising their health, emotional well-being and academic work and a wide range of physical and/or mental health conditions, as well as about the potential long-term effects on the individuals ability to realize her or his own potential; Also recognizing that violence against girls is based on discrimination, gender norms and gender inequalities and includes sexual and gender-based violence, child maltreatment, child, early and forced marriage, sexual harassment, female genital mutilation, partner violence, trafficking, and sexual exploitation and abuse, all of which requires specific attention by society, including health providers; Further recognizing that close interlinkages exist between the different forms of discrimination, violence and inequalities faced by children; Stressing that discrimination based on gender or age often overlaps with other forms of discrimination, as well as a range of social determinants, and that this may affect a childs vulnerability to violence and often compounds the impacts of crisis and conflict on children; Recognizing also that children with disabilities are more likely than other children to experience physical, psychological, sexual and gender-based violence and neglect; 66 SEVENTY-FOURTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY Recognizing further the special needs of and risks faced by migrant children, especially unaccompanied migrant children or children separated from their families, particularly with regard to all forms of violence, discrimination and exploitation, including sexual and gender-based violence, physical and psychological abuse, human trafficking and contemporary forms of slavery; Noting that victims of all forms of violence frequently suffer traumatic consequences that require care and treatment, and that psychosocial support needs to be provided to both victims and perpetrators to mitigate risks of violence in the future; Recognizing also that health systems are often not adequately addressing the problem of violence and the risk factors and determinants that cut across all forms of interpersonal violence, including violence against children, and not always contributing to a comprehensive, coordinated and multisectoral prevention and response to violence against children, and that strengthening health systems and achieving universal health coverage are essential to addressing both the risk factors for and determinants of violence against children and its consequences; Recognizing further that violence against children needs continuous, coordinated and multisectoral action for prevention, detection, response and monitoring; Concerned that violence against children is often exacerbated in humanitarian emergencies and in countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, and recognizing that health systems have an important role to play in preventing and responding to its consequences, underlining the need to protect health care facilities from attacks to ensure the delivery of health care services; Also recognizing that ensuring safe access and safeguarding the right to education, including in humanitarian emergencies and in countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, provides an environment that protects against violence and is an entry point for basic health and nutrition interventions; Acknowledging the need for greater international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels to address the issue of violence against children including in humanitarian emergencies and in countries in conflict and post-conflict situations; Stressing the importance of scaling up evidence-based preventive measures in line with obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures, to protect children from all forms of violence, including parent and caregiver support programmes and school- and community-based interventions, and public health and other measures to positively promote respectful child-rearing, free from violence, for all children, and to target the root cause of violence at the levels of the child, family, perpetrator, community, institution and society, and noting that these measures can be delivered by and with the health and other relevant sectors and civil society organizations, 1.
