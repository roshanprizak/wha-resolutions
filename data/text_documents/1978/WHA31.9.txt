WHA31.9  Method  of work  of the Health  Assembly  - П 
The Thirty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  recommendations  of the  Executive  Board  (resolution  EB61.R8)  1 concerning 
the method  of work  of the Health  Assembly; 
Noting  with  satisfaction  the conclusions  and  decisions  of the Board  on the  method  of work  of the 
Board  and  related  matters  ； 
Believing  that  the  proposed  changes  in respect  of the  proceedings  of the  Health  Assembly  would 
contribute  towards  further  rationalizing  and  improving  its work; 
1. DECIDES  that: 
(1) in order  to provide  for the consideration  of questions  of a specialized  technical  nature,  a subitem 
entitled  "Technical  activities  and  questions  identified  for additional  examination  during  the review  of 
the proposed  programme  budget  and  of the Executive  Board's  report  thereon"  shall  be included  in the 
agenda  of future  Health  Assemblies  under  the item  entitled  “Review  of specific  technical  matters"; 
(2) the  President  of the Health  Assembly  and  the chairmen  of the main  committees  shall  make  brief 
statements  explaining  to the Health  Assembly  the role  of the Executive  Board  representatives  at the 
Health  Assembly,  and  of the Board  itself  ； 
(3) the  present  seating  arrangements  in the committees  of the Health  Assembly,  by which  the Board's 
representatives  sit on the rostrum  together  with  the officers  of the committee  and  certain  members  of the 
Secretariat,  shall  be continued  ； 
(4) delegates  participating  in the  general  debate  in plenary  meetings  of the  Health  Assembly  shall 
speak  from  the rostrum  rather  than  from  their  seats,  through  arrangements  which  ensure  efficient  use 
of time;  in connexion  with  procedural  motions,  points  of order  and  explanations  of vote  they  shall  as a 
general  rule  speak  from  their  seats; 
(5) sponsors  of draft  resolutions  on technical  subjects  for consideration  by the main  committees  of the 
Health  Assembly  should  normally  be invited  to submit  with  them  whenever  feasible  and  appropriate 
(and  jointly  when  appropriate)  an explanatory  note  or memorandum  providing  background  information 
on the proposal  made,  provided  such  information  is not already  available  in the documentation  before 
the Health  Assembly,  it being  understood  that  the Secretariat  would  report,  in writing  if feasible  or appropriate,  on any  technical,  administrative  and  financial  implications  which  the proposal  might  have; 
(6) in the spirit  of the relevant  Rules  of Procedure,  and  in particular  of Rules  29，38  and 85, the President 
and the five  vice-presidents  of the Health  Assembly  and  the chairmen,  vice-chairmen  and  rapporteurs  of 
the two  main  committees  should  be invited  to speak  only  in those  capacities,  unless  no other  delegate 
from  their  country  is present; 
2. DECIDES  further  that: 
(1) a new  procedure  shall  be instituted  for the withdrawal  of candidatures  in the annual  election  of 
Members  entitled  to designate  a person  to serve  on the Executive  Board,  by adding  the following  paragraph  to Rule  102  of the Rules  of Procedure  of the Health  Assembly: 
“Members  included  in such  list other  than  the ten Members  which,  in the Committee's  opinion, 
would  provide,  if elected,  a balanced  distribution  of the Board  as a whole  may  withdraw  their 
candidatures  from  the list by notification  to the President  not  later  than  the closure  of working 
hours  on the day  preceding  the annual  election  by the Health  Assembly  of ten Members  to be entitled  to designate  a person  to serve  on the Board.  Any  such  withdrawal  shall  be published  in the 
Journal  of the Health  Assembly  and  announced  by the President  prior  to the commencement  of 
voting."; 
(2) the  procedures  pertaining  to the confirmation  of the formal  credentials  of delegates  or representatives 
who have  been  seated  on the basis  of provisional  credentials  already  accepted  by the Health  Assembly 
shall  be changed  by adding  the following  sentence  at the end  of the first  paragraph  of Rule  23 of the 
Rules  of Procedure  of the Health  Assembly: 
“The  Bureau  of the Committee  shall  be empowered  to recommend  to the Health  Assembly  on 
behalf  of the Committee  the acceptance  of the formal  credentials  of delegates  or representatives 
seated  on the basis  of provisional  credentials  already  accepted  by the Health  Assembly."
