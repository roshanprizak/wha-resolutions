The Sixteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that  the  programme  planned  under  the  Special  Account  for  Community  Water  Supply 
as set forth  in Official  Records  No.  121,  Annex  4, is satisfactory;  and 
Believing  that  this  programme  is of considerable  importance  in stimulating  and  assisting  countries  to 
develop  plans  for  community  water  supply  systems, 
1. EXPRESSES  the hope  that  more  countries  will  make  voluntary  contributions  to the Special  Account; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to implement  the planned  programme,  within  the broad  concept  of the 
third  general  programme  of work  for a specific  period,  to the extent  that  funds  become  available  through 
voluntary  contributions  to the  Special  Account;  and 
3. INVITES  the Director-General  to take  such  further  action  as would  most  effectively  contribute  to the 
development  of the community  water  supply  programme.
