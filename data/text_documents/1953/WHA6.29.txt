(1) to advance  from  the Working  Capital  Fund  such  sums  as may  be necessary  to finance  the  appropriations  for  the  financial  year  1954,  pending  receipt  of contributions  from  Members  ; sums  so 
advanced  shall  be reimbursed  to the Working  Capital  Fund  as contributions  become  available  ; 
(2) to  advance  such  sums  in 1954  as may  be necessary  to meet  unforeseen  or extraordinary  expenses, 
and to increase  the  relevant  Appropriation  Section  accordingly,  provided  that  not  more  than 
US $250,000  is used  for  such  purposes,  except  that  with  the  prior  concurrence  of the  Executive 
Board  a total  of US $500,000  may  be so used.  The  Director-General  shall  report  to the next  convening 
Health  Assembly  all advances  made  under  this  clause  and  the circumstances  relating  thereto,  and  shall 
make  provision  in the estimates  for reimbursement  of the Working  Capital  Fund  except  when  such 
advances  are  recoverable  from  other  sources  ; 
3. AUTHORIZES  the Executive  Board  to use an amount  not  exceeding  US $300,000  of the Working  Capital

contingencies,  this  authorization  being  given  in order  to comply  with  Article  58 of the Constitution.  Any 
amounts  so used  under  this  authorization  will  increase  the relevant  Appropriation  Section  and  are to be 
replaced  by making  specific  provisions  therefor  in the next  year's  annual  budget,  except  when  expenditures 
made  under  this  authority  are recoverable  from  some  other  source.
