FIFTY-FIRST WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA51.31
Agenda item 27.2 16 May 1998
Review of the Constitution and regional arrangements
of the World Health Organization
Regular budget allocations to regions
The Fifty-first World Health Assembly,
Recalling resolution EB99.R24 on regional arrangements within the context of WHO reform;Noting that regular budget allocations to regions have not been based on objective criteria but rather on the
basis of history and previous practice;
Concerned that, as a result, each region’s share of such allocations has remained largely unchanged since
the Organization’s inception;
Recalling that two basic principles governing the work of WHO are those of equity and support to countries
in greatest need;  and stressing the need for the Organization to apply principles which Member States haveadopted collectively;
Noting that other organizations of the United Nations system, particularly UNICEF, have already adopted
models based on objective criteria to ensure a more equitable distribution of programme resources to countries,
1. THANKS the Executive Board and its special group for the review of the Cons titution for the
comprehensive study of allocations from the regular budget to regions;
2. REAFFIRMS Article 55 of the Constitution which stipulates that it is the Director-General’s prerogative
to prepare and submit to the Board the budget estimates of the Organization, and requests her/him to take intoaccount the discussion on this matter during the Fifty-first World Health Assembly when preparing futureprogramme budgets;
3. RECOMMENDS that, globally, the regional, intercountry and country allocation in future programme
budgets approved by the Health Assembly should for the most part be guided by a model that:
(a) draws upon UNDP’s Human Development Index, possibly adjusted for immunization coverage;(b) incorporates population statistics of countries calculated according to commonly accepted methods,
such as “logarithmic smoothing”;WHA51.31
2(c) can be implemented gradually so that the reduction for any region would not exceed 3% per year and
would be spread over a period of three bienniums;
4. REQUESTS the Director-General to present a thorough evaluation of that model to the Fifty-seventh World
Health Assembly for the purpose of continuing response to health needs and equitable allocation of the resourcesof the World Health Organization;
5. DECIDES that the model should be applied in a flexible rather than a mechanical manner so as to minimize,
to the extent possible, any adverse effects on countries whose budgetary allocations will be reduced;
6. REQUESTS the Director-General to ensure that all least developed countries will be guaranteed during the
2000-2001 biennium that their allocation from the regular budget will not be less than that of the 1998-1999
budget by use of the 2% transfer from global and interregional activities foreseen in resolution WHA48.26 andby casual income if available;  and to continue in subsequent bienniums to give high priority to protect thesituation of least developed countries;
7. REQUESTS the Director-General, while emphasizing that any additional f unds resulting from the present
process of reallocation should flow to the country level, to enable regions within the terms of the Constitution todetermine for themselves the partition between country, intercountry and regional office budgets;
8. REQUESTS the Director-General to monitor and evaluate closely the working and the impact of this new
process in the light, in particular, of changes in international social and economic conditions, and to reportannually to the Executive Board and the World Health Assembly with a view to any further refinement,development or modification to ensure response to health needs and the equitable allocation of the resources ofthe World Health Organization;
9. REQUESTS the Director-General to report to the 103rd session of the Executive Board and to the
Fifty-second World Health Assembly on the details of the model and the regional, intercountry and countryallocations to be applied to the 2000-2001 biennium;
10. FURTHER REQUESTS the Director-General to report to the 103rd session of the Executive Board and
to the Fifty-second World Health Assembly within the context of the request in paragraph 4 above, on the useof extrabudgetary allocations in regional, intercountry and country programmes in the previous three bienniums.
