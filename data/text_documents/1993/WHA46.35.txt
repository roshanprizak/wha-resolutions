Agenda  item  18.3  14  May  1993 
BUDGETARY  REFORM 
The Forty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the  Executive  Board  on the  proposed  programme  budget  for the 
financial  period  1994-1995; 
Recalling  the  Board's  requests  to the  Director-General  in its resolution  EB91.R12; 
Reiterating  the  obligation  of ail Member  States  to pay  their  assessed  contributions  in full  and  on time; 
Mindful  of the  Organization's  obligation  to cooperate  in health  development  in Member  States  and 
conscious  of the  rising  costs  of health  care,  the  analysis  and  planning  of care  as well  as the  provision  of 
services; 
Recognizing  the  need  to ensure  that  WHO  carries  out  its programmes  in the  most  transparent,  most 
cost-effective  and  productive  manner，providing  the  best  value  for money  and  redirecting  resources  to reflect 
priority  health  needs; 
Reaffirming  the  fundamental  importance  of realistic  programme  targets  and  measurable  outcomes; 
Concerned  by the  growing  proportion  of the  Organization's  budget  that  goes  to pay  administrative  costs, 
including  staff  and  staff-related  costs,  and  recognizing  the  desirability  of an appropriate  ratio  between  these 
costs  and  the  costs  of overall  programme  delivery; 
Underlining  the  importance  of achieving  the  highest  standards  of accountability  and  transparency  within 
the programme  and  budget  of the  Organization; 
Concerned  by the  complexity  and  lack  of clarity  in existing  budget  documents  particularly  in the  failure  to 
relate  financial  allocations  and  staff  costs  to specific  health  priorities,  and  the  difficulty  this  poses  for the 
Executive  Board  and  the  World  Health  Assembly  in determining  and  establishing  the  strategic  and  financial 
priorities  of the  Organization; 
Welcoming  the  intention  expressed  by the  Director-General  to relate  the  presentation  of the  programme 
budget  to the  statements  of accounts，which  will  permit  assessment  of the  amounts  spent  on programmes  and 
their  results’ 
REQUESTS  the  Director-General: 
1. to  introduce  a clearer,  simpler，more  "user-friendly"  proposed  programme  budget  (blue  book)  for 
the financial  period  1996-1997; 
2. to  develop  an improved  budget  and  accounting  process  which:

Change,  a proposal  in conformity  with  the  recommendation  of the  Joint  Inspection  Unit  in its report
