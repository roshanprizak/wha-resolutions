56 FIFTY-SEVENTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY  
 
 
 
 
WHA57.18 Human organ and tissue transplantation 
The Fifty-seventh World Health Assembly,   
Recalling resolutions WHA40.13, WHA42.5 and WHA44.25 on organ procurement and 
transplantation; 
Having considered the report on human organ and tissue transplantation;1 
Noting the global increase in allogeneic transplantation of cells, tissues and organs; Concerned by the growing insufficiency of availa ble human material for transplantation to meet 
patient needs; 
Aware of ethical and safety risks arising in the transplantation of allogeneic cells, tissues and 
organs, and the need for special attention to the risks of organ trafficking; 
Recognizing that living xenogeneic cells, tissues or organs, and human bodily fluids, cells, 
tissues or organs that have had ex vivo  contact with these living xenogeneic materials, have the 
potential to be used in human beings when suitable human material is not available; 
Mindful of the risk associated with xenogeneic transplantation of the transmission of known or 
as yet unrecognized xenogeneic infectious agents from animals to human beings and from recipients 
of xenogeneic transplants to their contacts and the public at large; 
Recognizing that transplantation encompasses not only medical but also legal and ethical 
aspects, and involves economic and psychological issues, 
I 
Allogeneic transplantation 
1. URGES Member States:  
(1) to implement effective national oversight of procurement, processing and transplantation 
 of human cells, tissues and organs, including ensuring accountability for human material for 
 transplantation and its traceability; 
(2) to cooperate in the formulation of recommendations and guidelines to harmonize global 
 practices in the procurement, processing and tr ansplantation of human cells, tissues and organs, 
 including development of minimum criteria for suitability of donors of tissues and cells; 
(3) to consider setting up ethics commissions to ensure the ethics of cell, tissue and organ 
 transplantation; 
(4) to extend the use of living kidney donations when possible, in addition to donations from 
 deceased donors;

(5) to take measures to protect the poorest and vulnerable groups from “transplant tourism” 
 and the sale of tissues and organs, including attention to the wider problem of international 
 trafficking in human tissues and organs; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to continue examining and collecting global da ta on the practices, safety, quality, efficacy 
 and epidemiology of allogeneic transplantation and on ethical issues, including living donation, 
 in order to update the Guiding Principles on Human Organ Transplantation;1 
(2) to promote international cooperation so as to increase the access of citizens to these 
 therapeutic procedures; 
(3) to provide, in response to requests from Member States, technical support for developing 
 suitable transplantation of cells, tissues or organs, in particular by facilitating international 
 cooperation; 
(4) to provide support for Member States in their endeavours to prevent organ trafficking, 
 including drawing up guidelines to protect the poorest and most vulnerable groups from being  victims of organ trafficking; 
II 
Xenogeneic transplantation 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to allow xenogeneic transplantation only when effective national regulatory control and 
 surveillance mechanisms overseen by national health authorities are in place; 
(2) to cooperate in the formulation of recommendations and guidelines to harmonize global 
 practices, including protective measures in accordance with internationally accepted scientific 
 standards  to prevent the risk of  potential secondary transmission of any xenogeneic infectious 
 agent that could have infected recipients of xenogeneic   transplants or contacts of recipients, 
 especially across national borders; 
(3) to support international collaboration and coordination  for the prevention and surveillance 
 of infections resulting from xenogeneic  transplantation; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to facilitate  communication and international collaboration among health authorities in 
 Member States on issues relating to xenogeneic transplantation; 
(2) to collect data globally for the evaluation of practices in xenogeneic transplantation; 
(3)  to inform proactively Member States of infectious events of xenogeneic origin arising 
 from xenogeneic transplantation;

(4) to provide, in response to requests from Member States, technical support in 
 strengthening capacity and expertise in the field of xenogeneic transplantation, including policy making and oversight by national regulatory authorities; 
(5) to report at an appropriate time to the Health Assembly, through the Executive Board, on 
 implementation of this resolution.
