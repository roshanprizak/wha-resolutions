WHA30.54  Regional  production  of vaccines  for the Expanded  Programme  on Immunization 
The Thirtieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  that  the children  in developing  countries  constitute  a significant  proportion  of the population, 
that the  infant  morbidity  and  mortality  are  high  in these  areas,  and  that  a very  large  proportion  of these 
deaths  are due  to preventable  communicable  diseases; 
Realizing  that  these  morbidity  and  mortality  rates  can  be effectively  reduced  by immunization  as 
highlighted  by the resolutions  WHA27.57  and  WHA29.63; 
Considering  that  the production  of vaccines  for immunization  is inadequate  to meet  the global  requirements  and  that  regions  should  be self-sufficient  in vaccine  production  to effectively  implement  the Expanded 
Programme  on Immunization; 
1. DRAWS  ATTENTION  to the  importance  of the  policies  of the  Expanded  Programme  on Immunization 
with  respect  to promoting  regional  and  national  self-reliance  as regards  vaccine  production,  as expressed  in 
the progress  report  prepared  by the Director-General  ； 
2. URGES  the  Director-General  and  the  Regional  Directors  to implement  these  policies  as quickly  as 
possible,  taking  particular  note  of the need  to identify  the centres  which  should  develop  regional  vaccine 
production  capabilities  and  to ensure  that  the latest  technical  expertise  and  the necessary  resources  are made 
available  to them.
