1  
Wishing to promote evidence-based rational use of medicines by provide rs and consumers and 
better access to essential medicines;  
Aware that irrational use of medicines continues to  be an urgent and widespread problem in the 
public and private health sector in developed and developing countries with serious consequences in 
terms of poor patient outcome, adverse drug reactions , increasing antimicrobial resistance and wasted 
resources;  
Acknowledging that successful implementation of previous resolutions on antimicrobial 
resistance cannot be achieved without addressing the global problem of irrational use of medicines;

2 Recognizing that many countries do not have a stringent drug-regulatory authority nor a full 
national programme or body to promote rational use of medicines; 
Emphasizing that global initiatives to increase a ccess to essential medicines should adhere to the 
principle of rational use of medicines, and include adherence by patients; 
Concerned that insufficient attention and res ources are being directed towards tackling the 
problem of irrational use of medicines by prescribers, dispensers and consumers; 
Emphasizing the need for a comprehensive, sust ainable, national and sector-wide approach to 
promote the rational use of medicines; 
Recognizing that  financing of medicines and methods of arrangements for provider payments  
can have a major impact on rational use, and that appropriate policies on financing health care are 
required;  
Recognizing that there may be incentives for the irrational use of medicines throughout the 
health system, for example in some circumstan ces which give rise to conflict of interest;  
Concerned that direct-to-consumer or Internet sal es may give rise to irrational use of medicines; 
Convinced that it is time for governments, the hea lth professions, civil society, the private sector 
and the international community to pledge thei r commitment, including adequate resources, to 
promoting the rational use of medicines,
