WHA27.55  Adequacy  of health  statistical  information 
The Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  the vital  contribution  of the International  Classification  of Diseases  to international  cooperation  in the field  of health  statistics; 
Noting  that  the data  currently  provided  have  greatly  assisted  the development  of preventive  services  ； 
Recognizing  additional  needs  for appropriate  data  created  by expanding  activities  of planning  and  monitoring  of health  care  delivery  systems  ； 
Noting  also  the increasing  demand  for relevant  data  for the evaluation  of clinical  activities  ； and 
Concerned  with  the danger  that  these  additional  needs  may  be met  by the development  of a diversity 
of systems  in different  countries,  with  a consequent  lack  of international  communication, 
REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to ensure  that  the  next  Revision  of the International  Classification  of 
Diseases  includes  the means  of meeting  these  needs,  without  prejudice  to the continuing  use  of the Classification  for its traditional  purposes.
