The Fifth World Health Assembly, Having considered a report on the status of contributions and advances to the Working Capital Fund and on the arrears of contributions in respect of the 1948, 1949 and 1950 assessments, 1. NOTES that certain Members have liquidated their arrears in respect of those years, and that other Members have communicated with the Director-General indicating that they have included in their national budgets appropriations to liquidate their arrears ; 2. DRAWS to the attention of those Members who have not yet made such arrangements the fact that : (1) default or delay inpayment of their contributions has resulted in a drain on the Working Capital Fund and has placed undue liability on other Member States, (2) as a result of their continued non-payment it maybe necessary to abandon or curtail certain approved programmes of the Organization ; 3. CALLS upon those Members to take appropriate action to liquidate their arrears of contributions during 1952 ; 4. NOTES that while certain Members have paid their arrears of contributions for early years they are now becoming in arrears for the year 1950 onward because they have not made provision in their national budgets for continuity of payments ; 5. REQUESTS those Members to provide regularly in their annual budgets for their contributions to the World Health Organization and to pay such contributions as early as possible after they are due ; and 6. REQUESTS the Executive Board to furnish a complete report to the Sixth World Health Assembly on any Members whose assessments to the 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951 budgets have not been paid at the time of the convening of the Health Assembly, together with recommendations for any action that the Board may consider necessary and appropriate.
