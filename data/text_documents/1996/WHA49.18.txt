FORTY-NINTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY 
Agenda  item  30.1 WHA49.18 
25 May  1996 
Collaboration  within  the United  Nations  system  and 
with other  intergovernmental  organizations: 
Supply  of controlled  drugs  for emergency  care 
The Forty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  that controlled  drugs,  such  as opioid  analgesics,  are essential  medicines  for the treatment 
of human  suffering; 
Also recognizing  that  timely  international  supplies  of essential  medicines  are often  vital  for 
humanitarian  disaster  relief  operations  in emergency  situations; 
Concerned  because  speedy  international  supply  of opioid  analgesics  to sites  of emergencies  is 
impossible  because  of the export  and import  control  measures  that apply  to narcotic  drugs; 
Concerned  further  about  the similar  difficulties  experienced  even  with regard  to psychotropic  substances, 
as an increasing  number  of national  authorities  apply  stricter  control  measures  than are provided  under  the 
relevant  international  treaty; 
Noting,  with  satisfaction,  that the International  Narcotics  Control  Board  shares  such  concern; 
Convinced  that a practical  solution  to this problem  should  be found  through  intensified  dialogue 
between  the health  and drug  control  authorities  at all levels, 
1. URGES  Member  States  to initiate  or intensify  dialogue  between  health  and drug  control  authorities  in 
order  to establish  simplified  regulatory  procedures  that allow  timely  international  supply  of narcotic  drugs 
and psychotropic  substances  in emergency  situations; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to prepare,  in consultation  with  the relevant  United  Nations  bodies 
involved  in the international  control  of narcotic  drugs  and psychotropic  substances,  model  guidelines  to assist 
national  authorities  with  simplified  regulatory  procedures  for this purpose.
