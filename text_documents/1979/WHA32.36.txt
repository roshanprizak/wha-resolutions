METHOD OF WORK OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY 
The Thirty-second World Health Assembly,
Having considered the recommendations of the Executive Board1  concerning the 
work of the Health Assembly;method of
Believing that the proposed changes in respect of the proceedings of the Health Assembly 
would contribute towards further rationalizing and improving the work of the Assembly;
1. DECIDES that:
(1) neither main committee of the Health Assembly shall meet during plenary meetings of 
the Health Assembly, and that this provision supersedes paragraph II.1  of resolution 
WHA28.69;
(2) the role and functions of the rapporteurs of the main committees of the Health 
Assembly may include (a) participation in the preparation and presentation of draft 
resolutions, and (b) participation in any working groups which may be set up to prepare 
draft resolutions or to reconcile amendments to such resolutions;
(3) Executive Board representatives should help sponsors of draft resolutions by drawing 
attention to the existence of recent reports which might make a request for a further 
report on the same subject unnecessary, and to previously adopted resolutions or decisions 
that would appear to render the adoption of a new resolution unnecessary;
(4) informal meetings between delegates and the Secretariat on technical questions shall 
continue to be held in accordance with existing arrangements;
(5) the earlier practice of holding the Technical Discussions in small groups shall be 
resumed, and reports or accounts of the Technical Discussions shall continue to be 
published;
(6) the Board shall fix a preliminary daily timetable for the Health Assembly's 
consideration of its agenda and the General Committee shall review and approve this time­
table, subsequently revising it if and when required;
(7) the Executive Board, when preparing the provisional agenda of each regular session 
of the Health Assembly, shall take into consideration the desirability of achieving an 
appropriate balance in the volume of work in the Health Assembly from year to year, and 
in this connexion, as a general principle, individual technical programme items shall 
preferably be included in the agenda of the Health Assembly as separate items only in the 
years when the Health Assembly does not undertake a full review of the proposed biennial 
programme budget, thus allowing more time for such technical items and providing a better 
balance of work of the Health Assembly;
