Agenda item 12.5 28 May 20 19 
Water, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities  
 
The Seventy -second World Health  Assembly,  
Having considered the report on patient safety: water, sanitation and hygiene in health care 
facilities ;1 
Recalling  the Declaration of Astana from the Global Conference on Primary Health Care (Astana, 
25 and 26 October 2018) which envisages strengthening p rimary health care as the most inclusive, 
effective  and efficient approach to enhance people’s physical and mental  health, as well as social 
well-being, and that primary health care is a cornerstone of a sustainable health system for effective 
universal he alth coverage and health -related Sustainable Development Goals;  
Recalling also resolution WHA64.24 (2011) on drinking water, sanitation and health, which 
emphasizes the tenets of primary health care as set out in the Declaration of Alma -Ata on Primary Heal th 
Care and other resolutions recalled therein (WHA35.17 (1982), WHA39.20 (1986), WHA42.25 (1989), 
WHA44.28 (1991), WHA45.31 (1992), WHA51.28 (1998) and WHA63.23 (2010)) and resolution 
WHA70.7 (2017) which stressed the role of improving safe drinking water , sanitation facilities, health 
care waste management and hygiene practices in primary health care;  
Recalling further United Nations General Assembly resolution 64/292 (2010) on the human right 
to water and sanitation  and resolution 72/178 (2017) and the United Nations Human Rights Council 
resolution 39/8 (2018), both on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation;  
Noting that without sufficient and safe water, sanitation and hygiene services in health care 
facilities, countries  will not achieve the targets set out in Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure 
healthy lives and promote health and well -being for all at all ages) and Goal 6 (Ensure availability and 
sustainable management of water and sanitation for  all), including reducing maternal and newborn 
mortality and achieving effective universal health coverage, and those in Sustainable Development 
Goals 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), 7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable 
and mo dern energy for all,), 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and 
sustainable) and 13 (Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts);  
Noting also that the provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene services is fundamental for 
patient safety and has been shown to reduce the risk of infection for patients, carers, health workers and 
surrounding communities, and noting that progress towards the provision of those services in health care 
facilities would also allow for effective and timely prevention of cholera, and care for patients with the

2 disease, in addition to diarrhoeal and other diseases, as recognized in resolution WHA71.4 (2018) on 
cholera prevention and control;  
Recalling WHA68.7 (2015) on the global actio n plan on antimicrobial resistance, which 
underscores the critical importance of safe water, sanitation and hygiene services in community and 
health care settings for better hygiene and infection prevention measures to limit the development and 
spread of a ntimicrobial -resistant infections and to limit the inappropriate use of antimicrobial medicines, 
ensuring good stewardship;  
Noting the findings of the joint WHO and UNICEF report, WASH in health care facilities: global 
baseline report 2019 ,1 which revealed  that one in four health care facilities lack basic water services , 
one in  five have no sanitation  service  and 42% have no hygiene facilities at point of care;  underscoring 
the implications of not having these basics in these places, including the spread o f infections in places 
that are supposed to promote health and basic hygiene for disease prevention; and stressing the 
implications for the dignity of patients and other users who seek health care services, particularly women 
in labour and their newborn ba bies;  
Recalling the statement  of the United Nations Secretary -General , making a global call for action 
for water, sanitation and hygiene in all health care facilities;  
Noting that the Director -General’s report to the Seventy -first World Health Assembly on health, 
environment and climate  change2 identified global driving forces, including population growth, 
urbanization and climate change, which are expected to significantly affect the availability and quality 
of, and access to, water and sanitation services  and freshwater resources, and the urgent need for 
addressing the links between climate, energy, safe water, sanitation and hygiene and health,  
1. URGES Member  States:3 
(1) to conduct comprehensive assessments according to the national context and, where 
appropriate, to quantify: the availability and quality of, and needs for , safe water, sanitation and

provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities;6
