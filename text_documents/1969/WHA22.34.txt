WHA22.34 Smallpox  Eradication  Programme 
The Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the Director-General  on the  smallpox  eradication  programme; 
Noting  that,  while  very  significant  progress  is being  made  in the  eradication  effort,  not  all endemic 
countries  are proceeding  at the pace  necessary  to assure  the success  of the eradication  programme;  and 
Recognizing  the need  for  full  and  active  participation  by all endemic  countries,  for the maximum  of 
co-ordination,  and  for  more  complete  and  prompt  reporting  and  improved  surveillance  techniques, 
1. REITERATES  the need  for all countries  to give  the highest  possible  priority  to the provision  of funds  and 
personnel  to achieve  eradication  ； 
2. EXPRESSES  appreciation  to Member  States  for  continuing  support  to the  programme,  including  the 
supply  of vaccine  and  bilateral  aid to the endemic  countries; 
3. REQUESTS 
(1) all  countries  with  endemic  smallpox,  particularly  those  having  nomadic  and  mobile  populations, 
to strengthen  their  programmes,  surveillance,  case  investigations,  active  containment  measures  in each 
outbreak,  and  assessment  activities  ； and 
(2) all  countries,  especially  those  neighbouring  endemic  countries,  to continue  their  vaccination  programmes  and  surveillance,  especially  along  their  common  borders;  and 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  : 
(1) to  continue  to take  all necessary  steps  to assure  the maximum  co-ordination  of national  efforts,  as 
well as of support  provided  through  international  and  bilateral  agencies,  with  the objective  of achieving 
smallpox  eradication  as quickly  as possible;  and 
(2) to  report  further  on the progress  of the smallpox  eradication  programme  to the forty-fifth  session 
of the Executive  Board  and  to the  Twenty-third  World  Health  Assembly.
