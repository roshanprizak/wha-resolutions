Tuberculosis control: progress and 
long-term planning 
 
The Sixtieth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on tuberculosis control: pr ogress and long-term planning;1 
Noting the progress made since 1991 towards achiev ing the international targets for 2005, and 
more recently following the establishment, in r esponse to resolution WHA51.13, of the Stop TB 
Partnership; 
Aware of the need to build on this progress a nd overcome constraints in order to reach the 
international targets for tuberculosis control for 2015  set by the Stop TB Partnership – in line with the 
internationally agreed development goal relevant to tuberculosis containe d in the United Nations 
Millennium Declaration to “have halted by 2015 and be gun to reverse the incidence of major diseases” – of 
halving tuberculosis prevalence and death rates by 2015 compared with 1990 levels; 
Noting the development of the Stop TB strategy as a comprehensive approach to tuberculosis 
prevention and control that incorporates the intern ationally agreed tuberculosis control strategy 
(DOTS strategy) and represents a significant expans ion in the scale and scope of tuberculosis-control 
activities; 
Welcoming the Partnership’s Global Plan to Stop TB 2006–2015, which sets out the activities 
oriented towards implementing the Stop TB strate gy and achieving the international targets for 
tuberculosis control for 2015; 
Aware of the need to increase the scope, scale an d speed of research needed to achieve the 
international targets for tuberculosis control for 2015 and the goal of eliminating tuberculosis as a 
global public-health problem by 2050; 
Concerned that delays in implementing the Gl obal Plan will result in increasing numbers of 
tuberculosis cases and deaths, including those du e to multidrug-resistant (and extensively drugresistant) tuberculosis and to the impact of HIV,  and therefore in delays in achieving by 2015 the 
international targets for tuberculosis control and th e internationally agreed development goal relevant 
to tuberculosis contained in the Un ited Nations Millennium Declaration;

2 Recognizing the importance of the situation and the trends of multidrug-resistant and 
extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis as barriers to  the achievement of the Global Plan’s objectives 
by 2015, and the need for an increased number of Me mber States participating in the network of the 
Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistan ce Surveillance and for the required additional 
resources to accomplish its task;  
Recalling that resolution WHA58.14 encouraged Me mber States to fulfil their commitments to 
ensure the availability of sufficient domestic resour ces and of sufficient exte rnal resources to achieve 
the internationally agreed development goal relevant  to tuberculosis contained in the United Nations 
Millennium Declaration; 
Welcoming the contribution to the mobilizati on of resources for development by voluntary 
innovative financing initiatives taken by groups of Member States and, in this regard, noting the 
International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID), th e International Finance Facility for Immunisation 
and the commitment to launch a pilot project with in the advance market commitments initiatives, 
1. URGES all Member States: 
(1) to develop and implement long-term plans fo r tuberculosis prevention and control in line 
with the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006–2015, in the context of overall health development plans, in collaboration with other programmes (inc luding those on HIV/AIDS, child health and 
strengthening of health systems), a nd through national Stop TB partnerships  where appropriate, 
with the aim of:  
(a) accelerating progress towards the internati onal targets for tuberculosis control for 
2015 through full and rapid implementation of the Stop TB strategy with specific attention to vulnerable groups highly at ri sk, such as poor people, migrants and ethnic 
minorities;  
(b) accelerating improvement of health-information systems,  both in general and for 
tuberculosis in particular,  in order to serve the assessm ent of national programme 
performance; 
(c) ensuring high-quality implementation of the DOTS strategy by tuberculosis 
programmes as the first and foremost step in full implementation of the Stop TB strategy;  
(d) controlling the emergence and transmi ssion of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, 
including extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, by ensuring the high-quality implementation of the DOTS strategy and by  prompt implementation of infection-control 
precautions;  
(e) if affected, immediately addressing exte nsively drug-resistant tuberculosis and 
HIV-related tuberculosis  as part of the overall Stop TB strategy, as the highest health 
priorities;   
(f) enhancing laboratory capacity in orde r to provide for rapid drug-susceptibility 
testing of isolates obtained from all persons  with culture-positive tuberculosis, where 
resources are available, and promote access to  quality-assured sputum smear microscopy;    WHA60.19 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  (g) increasing access to quality-assured second- line medicines at af fordable prices 
through the Stop TB Partnership’s Green Light Committee; 
(h) accelerating collaborative interventions against HIV infection and tuberculosis;  
(i) fully involving the private sector in national tuberculosis control programmes;   
(2) to use all possible financing mechanisms in order to fulfil the commitments made in 
resolution WHA58.14, including that to ensure sustainable domestic and external financing,  
thereby filling the funding gaps identifie d in the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006 –2015;  
(3) to declare, where appropriate, tuberculos is as an emergency and to allocate additional 
resources in order to strengthen activities aimed at stopping the spread of extensively drugresistant tuberculosis;  
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to intensify support provided to Member States in expanding implementation of the 
Stop TB strategy by developing capacity  and improving the performance of national 
tuberculosis-control programmes, particularly the quality of DOTS activities,  and by 
implementing infection-control precautions  within the broad context of strengthening health 
systems in order to achieve the international targets for 2015; 
(2) to continue to provide support for the ne twork of the Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis 
Drug Resistance Surveillance by increasing the num ber of Member States in the network in 
order to inform the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006– 2015 through determination of the extent and 
trend of multidrug-resistant and extens ively drug-resistant tuberculosis;  
(3) to strengthen urgently WHO’s support to countries affected by multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis and especially  extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, and to countries highly 
affected by HIV-related tuberculosis;  
(4) to enhance WHO’s leadership within  the Stop TB Partnership in its coordination of 
efforts to implement the Global Plan to St op TB 2006–2015 and to  facilitate long-term 
commitment to sustainable financing of the Global Plan through improved mechanisms for 
increased funding;   
(5) to strengthen mechanisms to review and m onitor estimates of impact of control activities 
on the tuberculosis burden, including incidence, prevalence and mortality with specific attention 
to vulnerable groups highly at risk, such as poor people, migrants and ethnic minorities;  
(6) to support Member States in developing laboratory capacity to provide for rapid drugsusceptibility testing of isolates obtained from all persons with culture-pos itive tuberculosis, to 
develop consensus guidelines for rapid drug- susceptibility test methods and appropriate 
measures for laboratory strengthening, and to mobilize funding;  
(7) to enhance WHO’s role in tuberculosis resear ch in order to promote the applied research 
necessary to reach the international targets for tuberculosis control for 2015 and the basic 
research necessary to achieve the goal of elimin ating tuberculosis by 2050; and to increase 
global support for those areas of tuberculosis  research that are currently underresourced,  WHA60.19 
 
 
  
 
 
4 especially enhancing research and development of  new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines and the 
relevance of nutrition to, and its interaction with, tuberculosis;  
(8) to report to the Sixty-third World Hea lth Assembly through the Executive Board on: 
(a) progress in implementation of the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006–2015, including 
mobilization of resources from domestic and external sources for its implementation; 
(b) progress made in achieving the internati onal targets for tuberculosis control by 
2015, using the “proportion of tuberculosis cases detected and cured under directly 
observed treatment, short course (DOTS)” (Millennium Development Goal indicator 24) as a measure of the performance of national pr ogrammes, and tuberculosis incidence and 
“prevalence and death rates associated with tuberculosis” (Millennium Development Goal 
indicator 23) as a measure of the impact of control on the tuberculosis epidemic.
