The Twenty-fourth World Health Assembly, Noting the Director-General's Annual Report on the work of the World Health Organization in 1970; 1 Being aware of the concern manifested at the continuous growth of radiation exposure of the population due to the increasing use of ionizing radiation for medical diagnostic and therapeutic purposes; Considering that to this growing medical radiation exposure other sources of irradiation maybe added as a result of increasing peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including radioisotopes; Recognizing that arise in the radiation exposure of the population results in a higher probability of deleterious biological effects affecting both the present and future generations; Considering, on the other hand, the important role of ionizing radiation in preventive medicine and medical care and the resulting improvement of health and saving of lives; and Desirous of improving the present situation and of obtaining the best possible relation between benefits and risks of the medical use of ionizing radiation, 1. INVITES Member States: (i) to co-operate in the development of epidemiological studies aimed at providing a better knowledge of the effects of ionizing radiation applied to medicine; (ii) to promote studies on, and introduce in medical practice, improved methods and techniques for the medical use of ionizing radiation from the point of view of both effectiveness and the reduction of radiation exposure of the population; and (iii) to setup radiation protection services related to the medical aswell as toother uses of ionizing radiation, for advisory purposes aswell as for the purposes of supervision and inspection; 2. REQUESTS the Director-General : (i) to study the question of the optimum use of ionizing radiation in medicine and the risks to health induced by the excessive or improper use of radiation; (ii) to draw up a programme of activities based on the rationalization of the medical use of ionizing radiation and on the improvement of related diagnostic and therapeutic techniques and equipment, including clinical dosimetry and radiological protection; and (iii) to report to the Twenty-fifth World Health Assembly on the results of his study and on this programme of activities.
