WHA21.36 Community  Water  Supply  Programme 
The Twenty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  progress  report  of the  Director-General  on  the  community  water  supply 
programme; 
Noting  that  the  rate  of progress  in the  global  effort  to improve  community  water  supplies,  while  substantial,  is still  not  commensurate  with  the  increasing  demand  for  more  and  better-quality  water  for healthful 
living,  consequent  on the natural  growth  of population  and  the continuing  urbanization  processes  in developing 
countries; 
Noting  with  satisfaction  that  the International  Bank  for Reconstruction  and  Development,  International 
Development  Association,  Inter-American  Development  Bank  and  bilateral  assistance  programmes  recognize 
community  water  supply  as a field  of investment  contributing  to social  and  economic  development; 
Recognizing  the  valuable  contribution  to the  solution  of rural  water  supply  problems  made  possible  by 
the co-ordinated  efforts  of the World  Health  Organization,  Member  States,  and  the United  Nations  Children's 
Fund;  and 
Reaffirming  the recommendations  to Member  States  included  in resolution  WHA  19.50, 
1. NOTES  with  appreciation  the  report  of the  Director-General  and  endorses  the  general  principles  and 
programme  therein; 
2. RECOMMENDS  to Member  States: 
(1) that  in carrying  out  their  health  protection  role  due  attention  be given  inter  alia  to: 
(a) the  stimulation  and  promotion  of safe  community  water  supplies  for  all people; 
(b) the  establishment  of national  standards  for  drinking-water  quality; 
(c) the  supervision  of the  sanitary  design  of water  systems  and  their  operation,  as well  as continuing  surveillance  of water  quality; 
(d) the  provision  of qualified  personnel  to carry  out  these  functions; 
(2) that  they  intensify  efforts  to strengthen  national  urban  and  rural  community  water  supply 
programmes  and  to include  provision  for  these  programmes  in their  national  plans  for  economic  and 
general  development; 
(3) that  they  continue  to seek  support  for  projects  to improve  community  water  supplies  under  the 
Technical  Assistance  and  Special  Fund  components  of the United  Nations  Development  Programme; 
3. DRAWS  the attention  of the regional  banks  for Asia  and  for Africa  to the needs  of Member  States  for longterm  low  interest  loans  for  improved  community  water  supplies;  and 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General: 
(1) to  provide  for continuing  leadership  in community  water  supply  by intensifying  programme  activities 
as presented  in his report,  in co-operation  with  international  and  other  agencies; 
(2) to  give  all possible  support  and  assistance  to Member  States  in connexion  with  their  rural  water 
supply  programmes,  maintaining  close  co-operation  with  UNICEF  and  other  relevant  agencies  for that 
purpose; 
(3) to  report  on the progress  of the programme  to the Twenty-third  World  Health  Assembly.
