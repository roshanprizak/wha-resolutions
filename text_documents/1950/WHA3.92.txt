The Third  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  noted  the report  of the Director-General  on the proposal  made  by the Belgian  delegation  for the 
establishment  of a World  Health  Defence  Fund,134  and 
Having  considered  the exchange  of correspondence  between  the International  Bank  for Reconstruction 
and Development,  the International  Monetary  Fund,  and  WHO,135 
1. BELIEVES,  nevertheless,  that  plans  should  continue  to be studied  with  the object  of supplementing  the 
normal  funds  available  to the Organization  as a further  means  of helping  to meet  the health  needs  of the 
world,  and 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to continue  to explore  the possibilities  of developing  ways  and  means  of 
providing  the financing  necessary  to carry  out these  objectives  and to report  any progress  made  to a subsequent 
session  of the Executive  Board.  The  Executive  Board  shall,  if it deems  it desirable,  refer  the matter  to the 
Fourth  World  Health  Assembly.
