Regarding  National  Committees  on Vital  and 
Health  Statistics 
CONSIDERING  the  needs  by health  organizations 
for current,  reliable  and  comparable  data  ; 
CONSIDERING  the  relatively  primitive  character 
of the  national  statistical  mechanisms  for  producing  such  data  ; 
CONSIDERING  the  intimate  relationship  between 
vital  records,  vital  statistics,  morbidity  statistics 
and population  statistics  ; and 
CONSIDERING  the  advantages  of developing  a 
degree  of international  uniformity  in certain  of 
these  methods  and  procedures, 
THE  CONFERENCE  RECOMMENDS 
1. that  all  governments  establish,  either 
singly  or  jointly,  national  committees  on  vital 
and health  statistics,  composed  of representatives 
of administrations  entrusted  with  the  compilation 
of such  statistics  ; 
2. that  such  national  committees  study 
broadly  the  problems  of producing  satisfactory 
national  and  international  statistics  in the  field 
of health  ; 
3. that  these  national  committees  also  study 
the problems  of producing  health  statistics  which 
are related  to the  family  structure  and  to the 
social-economic  and  occupational  background 
of the  individual  ; 
4. that  these  national  committees  in tropical 
regions  pay  particular  attention  to the  statistics 
needed  for  tropical  diseases  ;

facing  the  problems  of population  pressure  and 
malnutrition  pay  particular  attention  to  the 
statistics  needed  for  these  problems  ; 
6. that  all  national  committees  co-operate 
with  schools  of medicine  and  public  health  so as 
to come  to grips  with  the  problems  of statistical 
education  and  training  in the  field  of vital  and 
health  statistics  ; 
7. that  in view  of the  interest  signified  by 
delegates  from  various  countries  at the  Conference  :

services  ; 
the Canadian  and  United  States  National 
Committees  individually  or  jointly  pay 
particular  attention  to  the  methods  by 
which  health  statistics  might  be  interlinked  with  other  types  of related  statistics 
and in such  a manner  that  they  will  be 
based  on  a knowledge  of the  characteristics and  distribution  of the  population  ;

Switzerland,  the  United  Kingdom  and 
the United  States  of  America  study 
methods  of presentation  of statistics  of

Kingdom  and  of the  United  States  of 
America  pay  particular  attention  to the 
methods  for  obtaining  reliable  statistics

death  (classification  of periods  of gestation  under  28  weeks,  classification  of 
multiple  causes,  methods  of certification)  ; 
the competent  authorities  of France  and 
India  pay  particular  attention  to  the 
problems  of morbidity  and  mortality  from 
tropical  diseases  ;

8. that  these  national  committees  shall  report 
their  findings  and  recommendations,  from  time 
to time,  to an  expert  committee  of the  World 
Health  Organization  for  international  consideration,  clearance  of national  viewpoints  and  coordination  with  the  interested  statistical  services 
of other  inter-governmental  organizations.
