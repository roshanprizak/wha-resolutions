just and comprehensive  peace  based  on the principles  of international  legitimacy  and，in  particular,  on relevant 
United  Nations  resolutions,  including  the improvement  of health  conditions; 
Regretting  the refusal  of the Israeli  authorities  to allow  the Special  Committee  of Experts  to visit the
