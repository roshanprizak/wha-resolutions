Recalling  the  resolutions  on this  subject  adopted  by the  Twenty-third  World  Health  Assembly,2  the 
Executive  Board,3  and  the respective  Regional  Committees; 
Recognizing  the relationship  between  smoking  and  the development  of pulmonary  and  cardiac  disease, 
including  lung  cancer,  ischaemic  heart  disease,  chronic  bronchitis  and  emphysema;  and 
Believing  that  a sustained  effort  by health  and  education  authorities  and  others  is needed  to reduce 
tobacco  smoking  and  to prevent  the extension  of the habit,  with  special  attention  to young  people  and  pregnant 
women, 
1. THANKS  the Director-General  for his report; 
2. ENDORSES  the recommendations  contained  therein; 
3. CALLS  UPON  all Member  States  and Associate  Members  to give  all possible  consideration  to putting  these 
recommendations  into  effect;  and 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General: 
(i) to continue  to assemble  information  on the health  effects  of tobacco  smoking  and  the action  being 
taken  by countries  to reduce  the habit; 
(ii) to place  emphasis  on the control  and  prevention  of smoking  as an integral  part  of operating  programmes  as and  when  feasible; 
(iii) to continue  in co-operation  with  the United  Nations,  the specialized  agencies  and  the appropriate 
non-governmental  organizations  to foster  a greater  awareness  of the health  hazards  of smoking  and  to 
take whatever  action  is deemed  necessary  to reduce  them,  and  particularly  to draw  the attention  of the 
Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of the  United  Nations  to the  necessity  of undertaking  a study 
on crop  diversification  in tobacco-growing  areas  in view  of the  expected  decrease  in tobacco  consumption  ; 
(iv) to stimulate  the strengthening  of health  education  activities,  including  the production,  dissemination 
and exchange  of educational  materials  to discourage  the habit  of smoking;  and 
(v) to produce  a code  of practice  that  can guide  governments  in the formulation  of legislative  action 
relevant  to the health  consequences  of smoking.
