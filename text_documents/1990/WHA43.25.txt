HAZARDOUS  WASTES MANAGEMENT 
The Forty-third  World Health Assembly, 
Having examined 
disposal  and control the report of the Director-General  on hazardous  wastes : safe 
of health risks； 
Aware of the resolution  of the Regional  Committee  for the Eastern  Mediterranean  on 
hazardous  wastes : control  of health risks and safe disposal,  and of that of the Regional 
Committee  for Africa on the control  and disposal  of toxic and nuclear  wastes for health 
protection  in Africa; 
Aware that the unsafe handling  and disposal  of hazardous  wastes may cause serious 
contamination  of the environment,  with potential  serious  health consequences； 
Concerned  that, especially  in developing  countries,  national  capabilities  for proper 
management  of hazardous  wastes are constrained  by insufficient  scientific  expertise, 
human resources  and appropriate  regulations； 
Noting the steps which have been taken to control  the transboundary  movement  of 
hazardous  wastes through  the adoption  of the Basel Convention  on the Control  of 
Transboundary  Movements  of Hazardous  Wastes and their Disposal,  and through  the Code of 
Practice  for International  Transboundary  Movement  of Radioactive  Waste which is being 
developed  by IAEA； 
1. COMMENDS  the Director-General  for establishing  the WHO Commission  on Health and 
Environment,  which will examine,  inter alia, the subject  of hazardous  wastes and their 
potential  effects  on human health; 
2. THANKS  the Director-General  for his report,  and takes note of the recommendations 
contained  therein; 
3. URGES  Member States: 
(1) to establish  to strengthen  programmes  for environmentally  sound management  of 
hazardous  wastes in accordance  with health-based  standards； 
(2) to extend health surveillance  systems,  including  epidemiological  studies,  to 
identify  adverse  effects  on populations  of exposure  (actual  or potential)  to 
hazardous  substances  and to encourage  the international  exchange  of experts  in this 
area;

(4) to accede to and ratify,  as soon as possible,  the Basel Convention  on the 
Control of Transboundary  Movements  of Hazardous  Wastes and their Disposal； 
4. INVITES  bilateral,  multilateral  and international  agencies  to support  Member States 
in establishing  infrastructure  and programmes  for safe management  of hazardous  wastes； 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to ensure that WHO can collaborate  with Member States in developing  and 
carrying  out their programmes  on hazardous  wastes management  and, in particular,  in: 
(a) assessing  the health risks many of which are still unknown  at present 
resulting  from exposure  to hazardous  wastes； 
(b) identifying  their priorities  for controlling  the various  categories  of 
chemical  and infectious  wastes,  utilizing  the internationally  established 
definitions  and priority  listings； 
(c) identifying  relevant  and improved  technologies  for the handling  and 
disposal  of hazardous  wastes； 
(2) to develop  improved  health-based  criteria  upon which regulations  and standards 
can be established,  arid to contribute  to the preparation  of practical  technical 
guidelines  for safe handling  and disposal  of hazardous  wastes； 
(3) to facilitate  the dissemination  of technical  and scientific  information  dealing 
with various  health aspects  of hazardous  wastes,  and to promote  its application; 
(4) to collaborate  with the United Nations  Environment  Programme  and other relevant 
international  organizations  in addressing  intercountry  aspects  of hazardous  wastes 
and their disposal  to ensure that health concerns  are taken into account.
