Whereas the development of planned programmes requires continuous application of research and investigation on many problems, the solution of which maybe found essential for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease, and for the promotion of positive health ; Whereas research includes field investigations aswell as those conducted in laboratories, The Second World Health Assembly RESOLVES that the following guiding principles should be applied in the organization of research under the auspices of the World Health Organization : (1) research and co-ordination of research are essential functions of the World Health Organization ; (2) first priority should be given to research directly relating to the programmes of the World Health Organization ; (3) research should be supported in existing institutions and should form part of the duties of field teams supported by the World Health Organization ; (4) all locally supported research should be so directed as to encourage assumption of responsibility for its continuance by local agencies where indicated ; (5) the World Health Organization should not consider at the present time the establishment, under its own auspices, of international research institutions.
