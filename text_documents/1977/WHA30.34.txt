WHA30.34 Coordination  within  the United  Nations  system  : General  matters 
The Thirtieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on coordination  within  the United  Nations  system 
on general  matters  ； 
Noting  those  resolutions  of direct  concern  to WHO  which  were  adopted  by the United  Nations  General 
Assembly  at its thirty-first  session,  and  the  role  which  WHO  is expected  to play  in implementing  those 
resolutions; 
Noting  with  satisfaction  the improved  financial  situation  of the United  Nations  Development  Programme 
and endorsing  UNDP's  continuing  central  coordination  role  in technical  cooperation  ； 
Mindful  that  WHO's  activities  are interrelated  with  other  sectoral  activities  of the entire  United  Nations 
system,  and  that  the Organization  has  an important  contribution  to make  to these  activities  ； 
Underlining  the importance  it attaches  to the use of extrabudgetary  funds  by WHO  for the implementation 
of specific  responsibilities  which  the Organization  is called  upon  to carry  out in accordance  with  decisions  of 
the Health  Assembly; 
1. CONCURS  in the  steps  taken  by the  Director-General  to ensure  that  the  United  Nations  and  other 
organizations  and  institutions  of the United  Nations  system  are aware  of the activities  of WHO  so as to be 
able to take  them  into  account  during  the development  of their  own  sectoral  programmes; 
2. SUPPORTS  the concept  that  coordination  between  the organizations  of the United  Nations  system  should 
entail  closer  collaboration  between  organizations'  representatives  at the national  level,  as well  as with  the 
appropriate  government  authorities  for the purpose  of enhancing  joint  United  Nations  system-wide  action 
within  Member  States; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to further  ensure  that  appropriate  support  is given  to the  work  of the Administrative  Committee 
on Coordination  and  its subsidiary  bodies  in the expectation  that  health  and  health-related  factors  may 
usefully  serve  as a basis  for a more  effective  coordinated  approach  to overall  development; 
(2) to ensure  that  further  efforts  are made  to attract  extrabudgetary  resources  to complement  the WHO 
regular  programme  activities  ； 
(3) to continue  to report  to the Executive  Board  or the Health  Assembly  as appropriate  on coordination 
within  the United  Nations  system,  including  developments  regarding  budget  harmonization  in the United 
Nations  system,  the effect  of inflation  on budgets,  and  personnel  policies  and  practices.
