WHA19.51  Reports  of Expert  Committees 
The Nineteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  resolution  EB37.R8  adopted  by  the  Executive  Board  at its thirty-seventh  session;  and 
Considering  the  great  value  and  importance  of the reports  of the expert  committees  of the World  Health 
Organization, 
SUGGESTS  that  Member  States  ensure  that  wide  dissemination  be given  to recommendations  of expert 
committees  through  reference  to a national  expert  panel,  or otherwise,  so that  the  best  use  may  be made  of 
such  recommendations  in the  context  of the  development  of their  national  health  programmes.
