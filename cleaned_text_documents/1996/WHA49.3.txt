The Forty-ninth World Health Assembly, Noting with concern that, as at 31 December 1995: (a) the rate of collection in 1995 of contributions to the effective working budget for that year amounted to 56.31%, the lowest collection rate in WHO history, leaving US$ 177 293 158 unpaid in respect of 1995 contributions; (b) only 96 Members had paid their contributions to the effective working budget for that year in full, and 78 Members had made no payment; (c) total unpaid contributions in respect of 1995 and prior years exceeded US$ 243 million, 1. EXPRESSES deep concern at the unprecedented level of outstanding contributions, which has had a deleterious effect on programmes and on the financial situation; 2. CALLS THE ATTENTION of all Members to Financial Regulation 5.6, which provides that instalments of contributions shall be considered as due and payable in full by the first day of the year to which they relate, and to the importance of paying contributions as early as possible to enable the DirectorGeneral to implement the programme budget in an orderly manner; 3. REMINDS Members that, as a result of the adoption, by resolution WHA41.12, of an incentive scheme to promote the timely payment of assessed contributions, those that pay their assessed contributions early in the year in which they are due will have their contributions payable fora subsequent programme budget reduced appreciably, whereas Members paying later will have their contributions payable for that subsequent programme budget reduced only marginally or not at all; 4. URGES Members that are regularly late in the payment of their contributions to take immediate steps to ensure prompt and regular payment; 5. REQUESTS the Director-General to review, taking into account developments in other organizations of the United Nations system, all additional measures that maybe appropriate to the circumstances of WHO with a view to ensuring a sound financial basis for the implementation of programmes, and to report on this matter to the ninety-ninth session of the Executive Board and the Fiftieth World Health Assembly; WHA49.3 6. REQUESTS the Director-General to draw this resolution to the attention of all Members. Fifth plenary meeting, 23 May 1996 A49 / VR / 5
