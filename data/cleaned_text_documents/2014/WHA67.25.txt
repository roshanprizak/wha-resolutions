The Sixty-seventh World Health Assembly, Having considered the report on antimicrobial drug resistance ;1 Recognizing WHOs leadership role in the containment of antimicrobial resistance; Recalling resolutions WHA39.27 and WHA47.13 on the rational use of drugs, WHA51.17 on emerging and other communicable diseases: antimicrobial resistance , WHA54.14 on global health security, WHA58.27 on improving the containment of antimicrobial resistance, WHA60.16 on progress in the rational use of medicines and WHA66.22 on follow up of the report of the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development: Financing and Coordination; Aware that access to effective antimicrobial agents constitutes a prerequisite for most of modern medicine, that hard-won gains in health and development, in particular those brought about through the heal th-related Millennium Development Goals, are at risk due to increasing resistance to antimicrobials , and that antimicrobial resistance threatens the sustainability of the public health response to many communicable diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria and HIV / AIDS; Aware that the health and economic consequences of antimicrobial resistance constitute a heavy and growing burden on high-, middle- and low-income countries, requiring urgent action at national, regional and global levels, particularly in view of the limited development of new antimicrobial agents; Recognizing that the main impact of antimicrobial resistance is on human health, but that the contributing factors and consequences, including economic and others, go beyond health and therefore there is a need fora coherent, comprehensive and integrated approach at global, regional and national levels, in a One Health approach and beyond , involving different actors and sectors such as human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, environment and consumers; Noting that awareness of the broad scope and urgency of the threat posed has been limited and that previous resolutions of the Health Assembly and WHOs strategies for the containment of antimicrobial resistance have not yet been widely impleme nted; Recognizing that antimicrobial resistance involves awide range of pathogens including bacteria, viruses and parasites but that the development of resistance among some pathogens, particularly antibiotic-resistant bacteria, is of particular urgency and most in need of immediate attention; 1 Document A67 / 39. WHA6 7.25 2 Welcoming the establishment of the WHO Global Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance and the tripartite collaboration between FAO , OIE and WHO , 1. URGES Member States:1 (1) to increase political awareness, engagement and leadership in order to accelerate efforts to secure access to effective antimicrobials and touse them responsibly; (2) to take urgent action at national, regional and local levels to strengthen infection prevention and control, by means that include application of basic hygiene measures; (3) to develop or strengthen national plans and strategies and international collaboration for the containment of antimicrobial resistance; (4) to mobilize human and financial resources in order to implement plans and strategies to strengthen the containment of antimicrobial resistance; (5) to strengthen overall pharmaceutical management systems, including regulatory systems and supply chain mechanisms, and, where appropriate, laboratory infrastructure, with a view to ensuring access to and availability of effective antimicrobial agents, taking into account financial and other incentives that might have a negative impact on policies for prescribing and dispensing; (6) to monitor the extent of antimicrobial resistance including regular monitor ing of the use of antibiotics in all relevant sectors , in particular health and agriculture, including animal husbandry, and to share such information so that national, regional and global trends can be detected and monitored; (7) to improve, among all relevant care providers, the public and other sectors and stakeholders, awareness of (i) the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance, (ii) the need for responsible use of antibiotics and (iii) the importance of infection prevention and control measures; (8) to encourage and support research and development, including by academia and through new collaborative and financial models, to combat antimicrobial resistance and promote responsible use of antimicrobial medicines , develop practical and feasible approaches for extending the lifespan of antimicrobial medicines and encourage the development of novel diagnostics and antimicrobial medicines ; (9) to collaborate with the Secretariat in developing and implementing a draft global action plan to combat antimicrobial resistance , including antibiotic resistance, which is based on all available evidence and best practices; (10) to develop antimicrobial resistance surveillance system sin three separate sectors : (i) inpatients in hospitals ; (ii) ou tpatients in all other health care settings and the community ; and (iii) animals and non-human usage of antimicrobials ; 2. REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to ensure that all relevant parts of the Organization, at headquarters, regional and country levels, are actively engaged and coordinated in promoting work on containing antimicrobial 1 And, where appropriate, regional economic integration organizations.
