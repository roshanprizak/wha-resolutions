WHA12.38  Frequency  of World  Health  Assemblies 
The Twelfth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  examined  the report  of the Director-General  transmitted  to it by the Executive  Board;  1 and 
Believing  that,  notwithstanding  any  savings  that  might  accrue,  it would  not  be opportune,  at a time 
when  the  Organization  is expanding  and  its activities  developing,  to reduce  the  number  of occasions 
upon  which  the World  Health  Assembly  would  have  the opportunity  to direct  and  control  such  expansion 
and activities, 
1. DECIDES  that  at this  stage  in the development  of the Organization  no change  should  be made  in the 
periodicity  of sessions  of the  World  Health  Assembly;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  to consider  in what  way  and  to what  extent  the length  of the sessions 
of the  Health  Assembly  might  be reduced. 
Tenth  plenary  meeting,  26  May  1959  (section  9 of 
the third  report  of the Committee  on  Administration, 
Finance  and  Legal  Matters)
