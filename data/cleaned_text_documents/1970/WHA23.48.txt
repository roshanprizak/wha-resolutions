The Twenty-third World Health Assembly, Recalling resolutions WHA15.41, WHA16.36 and WHA17.39 of the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seven-teenth World Health Assemblies on the importance of communicating to WHO any decision to refuse the approval of anew drug, or to withdraw or restrict the availability of a drug already in use if such decision is taken as a result of serious adverse reactions, and requesting the Director-General to transmit immediately to Member States the information received; Acknowledging the value of information distributed through this intergovernmental information system so far; Noting that it is not only the serious adverse reactions caused by drugs that must be taken into consid-eration as factors detrimental to the health of the individual, but also their inefficacy; and Noting also that ineffective drugs are wasteful of individual and public economic resources, 1. INVITES all Member States to communicate to WHO any final decision made by national health author-ities to withdraw or restrict the availability of a drug already in use if the decision is taken because of lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness in relation to its toxicity and the purpose for which it is used; and 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to disseminate these decisions in addition to decisions taken as A result of serious adverse reactions, as specified in resolution WHA16.36. Handb. Res., 10th ed., 1.10.1 Fifteenth plenary meeting, 21 May 1970 (Committee A9 fourth report)
