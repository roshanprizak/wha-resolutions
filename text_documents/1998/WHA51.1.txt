FIFTY-FIRST WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA51.1
Agenda item 23.2 12 May 1998
Status of collection of assessed
contributions
The Fifty-first World Health Assembly,
Noting with concern that, as at 31 December 1997:(1) the rate of collection in 1997 of contributions to the effective working budget for that year amounted
to 78.27%, leaving US$ 91 110 877 unpaid;
(2) only 105 Members had paid their contributions to the effective working budget for that year in full,
and 61 Members had made no payment;
(3) total unpaid contributions in respect of 1997 and prior years exceeded US$ 174 million,
1. EXPRESSES deep concern at the continuing high level of outstanding contributions, which has had a
deleterious effect on programmes and on the financial situation;
2. CALLS THE ATTENTION of all Members to Financial Regulation 5.6, which provides that instalments
of contributions shall be considered as due and payable in full by the first day of the year to which they relate,and to the importance of paying contributions as early as possible to enable the Director-General to implementthe programme budget in an orderly manner;
3. REMINDS Members that, as a result of the adoption, by resolution WHA41.12, of an incentive scheme
to promote the timely payment of assessed contributions, those that pay their assessed contributions early in theyear in which they are due will have their contributions payable for a subsequent programme budget reducedappreciably, whereas Members paying later will see their contributions payable for that subsequent programmebudget reduced only marginally or not at all;
4. URGES Members that are systematically late in the payment of their contributions to take immediate steps
to ensure prompt and regular payment;
5. REQUESTS the Director-General to continue to review, taking into account developments in other
organizations in the United Nations system, all additional measures that may be appropriate to the circumstancesof WHO with a view to ensuring a sound financial basis for programmes and to report on this matter to theExecutive Board at its 103rd session and to the Fifty-second World Health Assembly;
6. FURTHER REQUESTS the Director-General to draw this resolution to the attention of all Members.
