The Twenty-third World Health Assembly, Being concerned about the potential hazards of food additives to the consumer; Aware of the increasing research done on toxicity of food additives Having noted the intensive publicity commonly given by the lay press to questions of safety of food additives and the widespread repercussions which follow action by any country to limit or prohibit the use of a generally used food additive; Noting that the matter was raised at the forty-fifth session of the Executive Board; and Agreeing that there is an urgent need for rapid dissemination of the results of toxicity research on food additives, including the results and consequences of evaluation of such studies, 1. REQUESTS Member States : (i) to communicate immediately to WHO any decision to limit or prohibit the use of a food additive and (ii) to supplement as soon as possible such information with the data in support of the decision taken; and 2. REQUESTS the Director-General, where such action would be useful : (i) to transmit immediately to Member States information received under paragraph 1 (ii) to take expeditious steps to evaluate any significant new evidence of toxicity of a specific food additive, including if necessary the convening of a meeting of experts, where appropriate in consultation with F AO; and (iii) to distribute promptly to Member States any conclusions of such a meeting.
