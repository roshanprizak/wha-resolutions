Poliomyelitis: mechanism for management 
of potential risks to eradication 
 
The Sixtieth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on eradication of poliomyelitis; 1 
Recalling resolution WHA59.1, urging Member States in which poliomyelitis is endemic to act 
on their commitment to interrupting transmission of wild poliovirus; 
Recognizing that the occurrence of endemic poliovirus is now restricted to geographically 
limited areas in four countries; 
Recognizing the need for international consensus on long-term policies to minimize and manage 
the risks of re-emergence of poliomyelitis in the post-eradication era; 
Recognizing that travellers from areas where poliovirus is still circulating may pose a risk of 
international spread of the virus; 
 Noting that the maintenance of high routine immunization coverage in  poliomyelitis-free 
countries contributes to reducing the risk of outbreaks of disease due to wild poliovirus and minimizes the risk of outbreaks due to vaccine-derived poliovirus; 
Noting that planning for such international consensus must commence in the near future, 
1. URGES all Member States where poliomyelitis is still prevalent  in certain geographical areas, 
especially the four countries in which poliomyelitis is endemic: 
(1) to establish mechanisms to enhance political commitment to, and engagement in, 
poliomyelitis eradication activities at all levels, and to engage local leadership and members of the remaining poliomyelitis-affected populations in order to ensure full acceptance of, and 
participation in, poliomyelitis immunization campaigns; 
(2) to intensify poliomyelitis eradication activities in order rapidly to interrupt all remaining 
transmission of wild poliovirus;

2 2. URGES all Member States: 
(1) to review and, if appropriate, update national recommendations on immunization against 
poliomyelitis in order to reduce the risk of international spread of disease;  
(2) to reduce the potential consequences of international spread of wild poliovirus by 
achieving and maintaining routine immunization coverage against poliomyelitis greater than 
90% and, where appropriate, conducting supplementary poliomyelitis immunization activities 
through additional campaigns in close collaboration with mass media and involvement of the 
general public; 
(3) to strengthen active surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis in order rapidly to detect any 
circulating wild poliovirus and prepare for certification of poliomyelitis eradication; 
(4) to prepare for the long-term biocontainment of polioviruses by implementing the 
measures set out under phases 1 and 2 in the current edition of the WHO global action plan for laboratory containment of wild polioviruses;

3. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to continue to provide technical support to the remaining Member States where 
poliomyelitis is still prevalent in their efforts to interrupt the final chains of transmission of wild 
poliovirus, and to Member States at high risk of an importation of poliovirus; 
(2) to assist in mobilizing financial resources to eradicate poliomyelitis from the remaining 
areas where poliovirus is circulating,  to provide support to countries currently free of 
poliomyelitis that are at high risk of an importation of poliovirus, and to minimize the risks of 
re-emergence of poliomyelitis in the post-eradication era; 
(3) to continue to work with other organizations of the United Nations system on security 
issues, through mechanisms such as “days of tranquillity”, in areas where better access is 
required to reach all children; 
(4) to continue to examine and disseminate measures that Member States can take for 
reducing the risk and consequences of international spread of polioviruses, including, if and when needed, the consideration of temporary or standing recommendations, under the International Health Regulations (2005), if such a recommendation were made, the financial and 
operational issues arising from its implementation, and lessons drawn, should be reported to the 
Health Assembly; 
(5) to submit proposals to the Sixty-first World Health Assembly with a view to minimizing 
the long-term risks of reintroduction of poliovirus or re-emergence of poliomyelitis in the post-eradication era, by establishing international consensus on the long-term use of poliomyelitis 
vaccines and biocontainment of infectious and potentially infectious poliovirus materials.
