ARREARS  OF CONTRIBUTIONS  PAYABLE  BY FORMERLY 
INACTIVE  MEMBERS  BELARUS  AND  UKRAINE 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  studied  the report  of the Director-General  on the arrears  of contributions  payable  by the 
formerly  inactive  Members,  Belarus  and Ukraine,  upon  resumption  of active  membership; 
Considering  the provisions  of the Constitution  governing  the financial  obligations  of Members,  together 
with the provisions  of the Financial  Regulations; 
Having  noted  the principles  and policies  laid down  in resolution  WHA9.9  which  were  applied  to certain 
Members  in the 1950s  upon  their  resumption  of active  membership; 
Recognizing  that the exceptional  circumstances  of Belarus  and Ukraine  justified  a deferment  of the 
instalment  payment  plan in respect  of prior  years'  arrears  of contributions  envisaged  in resolution  WHA9.9; 
Noting  that the contributions  for 1992  and future  years  will be due and payable  in accordance  with 
Financial  Regulation  5.6, 
1. DECIDES  that contributions  must  be paid in full for the years  1948  and 1949  during  which  Belarus  and 
Ukraine  participated  actively  in the work  of the Organization; 
2. DECIDES  pursuant  to resolution  WHA9.9  that, for the years  1950 to 1991  during  which  Belarus  and 
Ukraine  did not actively  participate  in the work  of the Organization,  a token  payment  of five per cent of the 
amount  assessed  each year shall be required  which  shall,  upon  payment,  be considered  as discharging  in full 
the financial  obligations  of those  Members  for the years  concerned; 
3. DECIDES  that the payments  required  under  paragraphs  1 and 2 above  must  be paid in US dollars  or 
Swiss francs;  and may be paid in equal  annual  instalments  over a period  not exceeding  ten years  beginning 
with the year 1997，in  addition  to the annual  contributions  due during  that period;  and that payment  of those 
annual  amounts  shall be construed  as preventing  the application  of the provisions  of Article  7 of the 
Constitution; 
4. DECIDES  that,  in accordance  with Financial  Regulation  5.8，payments  made  by the Members  concerned 
shall be credited  first to the Working  Capital  Fund;  and, further, 
5. DECIDES  that,  notwithstanding  the provisions  of Financial  Regulation  5.8, payments  of contributions  for 
the years  beginning  with that in which  the Members  return  to active  participation  shall  be credited  to the 
financial  period  concerned; I

those years; 
7. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to inform  the Members  concerned  of these  decisions.
