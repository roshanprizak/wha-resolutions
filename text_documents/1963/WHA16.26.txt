The Sixteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that  the programme  planned  under  the Special  Account  for Medical  Research  as set forth 
in Official  Records  No.  121,  Annex  4, is satisfactory; 
Noting  that  this  programme  is complementary  to the research  programme  included  in the regular  budget 
of the Organization;  and 
Emphasizing  the  world-wide  importance  of medical  research, 
1. EXPRESSES  the hope  that  more  countries  will  make  voluntary  contributions  to the Special  Account; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to implement  the medical  research  programme,  within  the broad  concept 
of the third  general  programme  of work  for a specific  period,  to the extent  that  funds  become  available 
through  voluntary  contributions  to the Special  Account;  and 
3. INVITES  the Director-General  to take  such  further  action  as would  most  effectively  contribute  to the 
development  of the medical  research  programme.
