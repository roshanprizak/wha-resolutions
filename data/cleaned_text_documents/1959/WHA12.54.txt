The Twelfth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Director-General on smallpox eradication; 1 Noting : (1) that although great progress has been made in the eradication of the disease in some areas of the world, important endemic foci of smallpox still remain in other areas, especially in South-East Asia and Africa, from which the disease can be exported to countries already free of it; (2) that eradication of smallpox from an endemic area can be accomplished by successfully vaccinating or revaccinating 80 per cent, of the population within a period of four to five years, as has been demonstrated in several countries; (3) that sufficient scientific and technical information is available on the production of a suitable smallpox vaccine; and (4) that although an eradication programme may require, for four or five years, an increase in the national efforts and financial obligations for the intensified campaign against smallpox, the heavy annual burden of continuing expenditure incurred for this purpose maybe considerably lightened by increasing the interval between vaccinations once eradication maybe considered to have been accomplished, 1. EMPHASIZES the urgency of achieving world-wide eradication; 2. RECOMMENDS to the health administrations of those countries where the disease is still present that they organize and conduct, as soon as possible, eradication programmes, making provision for the availability of a potent stable vaccine; 3. REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to urge health administrations of those countries where the disease is still present to develop eradication programmes and to offer them any necessary technical guidance and advice; (2) to provide for the necessary activities to further smallpox eradication programmes and for the assistance requested by national health administrations for this purpose, in his programme and budget for future years; and (3) to collect from the countries concerned information on the organization and progress of their respective eradication programmes and to report further to the Thirteenth World Health Assembly.
