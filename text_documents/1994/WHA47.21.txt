Assessments  of the Czech  Republic 
and Slovakia 
The Forty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that  the percentage  rates  of assessments  assigned  to the Czech  Republic  and Slovakia 
under  resolution  WHA46.15  were  provisional  and subject  to amendment,  if necessary,  to take  account  of 
the United  Nations  rates  of assessment  for these  Members,  to be established  by the United  Nations 
General  Assembly  at a later  date; 
Noting  that  by United  Nations  resolution  48/223  adopted  in December  1993  the United  Nations 
General  Assembly  established  percentage  assessment  rates  applicable  to the Czech  Republic  and Slovakia 
in the United  Nations  scale  of assessment  of 0.42%  and 0.13%  respectively; 
Recalling  the principles  and criteria  established  by resolutions  WHA24.12  and WHA26.21  applicable 
to the basis  for calculating  the WHO  scale  of assessments; 
DECIDES  that  the percentage  rates  of assessment  applicable  to the Czech  Republic  and Slovakia  in 
the WHO  scale  of assessments  for the financial  period  1994-1995  should  be adjusted  from  the provisional 
rates  of 0.36%  and 0.18%  respectively  to definitive  rates  of Q.41%1  and 0.13%  respectively.

A47/VR/14 
1 The  difference  of 0.01%  between  the  assessment  rate  of 0.42%  in the United  Nations  and  the suggested  rate  of 
0.41%  in WHO  is due  to the difference  in membership  of these  two  bodies. I
