The Thirty-fourth World Health Assembly, Noting the report and proposals of the Director-General^and the views of the Executive Board with regard to the recruitment of international staff in WHO Recalling resolution WHA33.30 and the earlier resolutions of the Health Assembly, the Executive Board and the United Nations General Assembly mentioned therein Considering also resolution 35 / 210 of the United Nat ions General Assembly; Recalling Article 35 of the Constitution, which states that the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff shall be to assure that the efficiency, integrity and internationally representative character of the Secretariat shall be maintained at the highest level, with due regard being paid also to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible and convinced that this is compatible with the principle of equitable geographical distribution Emphasizing the Director-General1 s prerogative to appoint the staff of the Secretariat under the authority conferred upon him by the same article of the Constitution and the Staff Regulations established by the Health Assembly Concerned that an imbalance in the geographical distribution of the professional and higher graded staff of the Organization continues to exist despite the progress made by the Director-General in achieving a more balanced and equitable distribution of such staff Concerned by the fact that the proportion of women on the staff has not increased, and noting that Member States propose very few women candidates for consideration; 1. REQUESTS the Director-General to modify the method of calculating desirable ranges in line with that adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, taking into account WHO'S membership and the size of its Secretariat 2. REQUESTS the Executive Board to review the question of desirable ranges after the United Nations General Assembly has done so at its forty-first session, and to report thereon to the Health Assembly 3. ESTABLISHES a target of 40% of all vacancies arising in professional and higher graded posts subject to geographical distribution during the period 1981-1982 for the appointment of nationals of unrepresented and under-represented countries, in order to ensure that such countries achieve or more closely attain their desi rabie range in that period, while ensuring that those countries already within their desirable range remain adequately represented 4. REQUESTS the Director-General, while nevertheless reaffirming that no post should automatically be considered the exclusive preserve of any Member State, to continue to permit replacement of separated incumbents by candidates of the same 1 Document 67 / 1981 / REC / 1, Annex 12. WHA34.15 page 2 nationality within a reasonable time frame whenever this is necessary to ensure that the representation of Member States whose nationals serve primarily on fixedterm contracts is not adversely affected 5. CALLS UPON the Director-General : (1) to pursue and intensify his efforts to appoint more women to the staff of WHO, particularly at senior levels (2) to include information thereon in his annual reports to the Executive Board and the Health Assembly (3) to review the reasons for the apparently insufficient availability of women candidates 6. URGES Member States to assist the Director-General's efforts to increase the number of women on the staff by proposing a considerably higher proportion of well-qualified women candidates 7. DECIDES to maintain the presently existing policy regarding career service appointments, which limits the award of such appointments to the minimum required by the Organization's programme, pending the outcome of the studies on this matter requested by the United Nations General Assembly; 8. REQUESTS the Director-General to continue and intensify his efforts to further improve procedures for the recruitment of international staff subject to geographical distribution, keeping in mind the practice of the United Nations.
