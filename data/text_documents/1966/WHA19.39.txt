WHA19.39 Effects  of Atomic  Radiation 
The Nineteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  the  mounting  concern  of world  opinion  at the  harmful  effects  to present  and  future  generations  resulting  from  the  increase  in the  levels  of radiation  to which  man  is exposed  from  nuclear  and 
thermonuclear  weapon  tests,  superimposed  on  other  sources  of radiation; 
Noting  that  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  has  been  seized  of the  question  of the  urgent  need 
for the  suspension  and  discontinuance  of all test  explosions  of nuclear  weapons  since  1954; 
Noting  further  that  a United  Nations  Scientific  Committee  on the  Effects  of Atomic  Radiation  was 
established  in 1955  and  has  since  submitted  three  reports  on the  effects  of atomic  radiation  and  that  it will 
be submitting  another  report  of its estimates  of risk  from  such  explosions  to the  forthcoming  twenty-first 
session  of the  General  Assembly; 
Conscious  of the  warning  given  in the  second  report  of the  Scientific  Committee  that  " the  effects  of 
any increase  in radiation  exposure  may  not  be fully  manifested  for  several  decades  in the  case  of somatic 
disease  and  for  many  generations  in the  case  of genetic  damage  "; and 
Recalling  in particular  United  Nations  General  Assembly  resolutions  1762  (XVII),  which  condemns 
all nuclear  weapon  tests,  and  2032  (XX),  which  "calls  upon  all countries  to respect  the  spirit  and  provisions 
of the  Treaty  banning  nuclear  weapon  tests  in the  atmosphere,  in outer  space  and  under  water", 
1. COMMENDS  the  United  Nations  Scientific  Committee  on the  Effects  of Atomic  Radiation  for  its valuable 
contribution  to wider  knowledge  and  understanding  of the  deleterious  effects  and  danger  levels  of atomic 
radiation,  and  WHO  and  other  international  bodies  for  the  valuable  assistance  rendered  by them  to the 
Scientific  Committee; 
2. REITERATES  resolution  WHA13.56,  which  emphasizes  the  need  for  national  health  authorities  "to  accept 
their  major  role  and  accelerate  their  activities  in the  public  health  aspects  of radiation  from  all sources", 
and resolution  WHA17.47,  which  reaffirms  "the  responsibility  of WHO  at the  international  level  for 
activities  in the  field  of health  involving  ionizing  radiation,  including  protection  from  radiation  hazards 
and the  medical  uses  of radiation  and  radioactive  isotopes"; 
3. CALLS  UPON  all countries  to co-operate  in preventing  an increase  in the  level  of background  radiation 
in the  interests  of the  health  of the  present  and  future  generations  of mankind; 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General,  in view  of the  special  danger  to the  health  of present  and  future  generations,  to continue  a thorough  study  of the  effects  of radiation  on man  and  report  to the  World  Health 
Assembly  at appropriate  intervals  so as to focus  attention  on necessary  action  on the  part  of Member  States; 
and 
5. URGES  Member  governments  to make  use  of WHO's  assistance  in the  development  and  strengthening 
of their  programmes  in the  control  of health  hazards  due  to radiation.
