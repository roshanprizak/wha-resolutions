WHA13.55 Malaria  Eradication  Programme 
The Thirteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on the development  of the malaria  eradication 
programme; 
Noting  the satisfactory  progress  that  has  been  made  in the world-wide  campaign  for malaria  eradication; 
Recognizing  that  the  operational  supervision  and  epidemiological  assessment  which  are  essential 
for the continuing  success  of the campaign  can  only  be ensured  by the adequate  staffing  of national  malaria 
eradication  services  with  fully-trained  personnel; 
Noting  the steps  that  have  been  taken  by the Director-General  to provide  increased  facilities  for the 
training  of the required  national  personnel  as well  as to meet  the request  for technical  advisory  services 
needed  by the governments; 
Believing  that  it is important  to keep  constantly  in mind  the essential  element  of urgency  in malaria 
eradication  programmes,  which  must  be time-limited  programmes,  and  that  adequate  organizational 
and financial  support  is indispensable;  and 
Recognizing  that  co-ordination  between  neighbouring  countries  is of special  importance  to countries 
reaching  an advanced  stage  in their  eradication  programmes  and  that  a fundamental  element  for such 
co-ordination  is the regular  reporting  of the progress  of operations  and  more  particularly  of epidemiological  assessment, 
1. URGES  governments  concerned  to intensify  their  efforts  for the training  and  provision  of adequate 
technical  and  administrative  personnel  required  to strengthen  the supervisory  and  epidemiological  assessment  activities  of their  malaria  eradication  services,  taking  full  advantage  of the facilities  provided  by the 
Organization; 
2. URGES  governments  concerned  to accord  to their  national  malaria  eradication  programmes  the priority 
needed  for the successful  completion  of the campaign  within  the shortest  period  of time; 
3. REQUESTS  governments  concerned  to continue  to keep  the  Organization  regularly  informed  of the 
progress  of their  malaria  eradication  programmes  and,  in particular,  of their  epidemiological  assessment 
activities  ; 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to keep  under  constant  review  the  progress  of the  world-wide 
programme,  to make  available  to governments  such  technical  advisory  services  as may  be required,  and 
to continue  to take  all the necessary  steps  to ensure  the proper  co-ordination  of programmes  throughout 
the world;  and 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to establish  an official  register  listing  areas  where  malaria  eradication 
has been  achieved,  after  inspection  and  certification  by a WHO  evaluation  team.
