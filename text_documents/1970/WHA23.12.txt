The Twenty-third  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on measures  taken  in pursuance  of the revised 
global  strategy  of malaria  eradication  adopted  by the Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly  in resolution 
WHA22.39; 
Recognizing  the importance  of close  collaboration  between  governments  and  the assisting  agencies  in 
reviewing  malaria  eradication  programmes  to determine  the future  course  of action  best  suited  to the specific 
requirements  of each  country; 
Realizing  that  malaria  constitutes  a major  public  health  problem  in many  tropical  countries  where 
eradication  is at present  impracticable,  and  that  there  is an urgent  need  to reduce  its ravages  and  to facilitate 
the promotion  of socio-economic  development; 
Realizing  the importance  of research  for finding  new  weapons  and  for evolving  rational  methods  of 
controlling  malaria,  as well  as for improving  diagnostic  and  treatment  techniques  and  methods  of vector 
control  applicable  to various  specific  epidemiological  situations  ； and 
Realizing  further  that  safe,  effective  and  inexpensive  insecticides  are essential  for the effective  control 
of malaria, 
1. NOTES  with  satisfaction  the action  taken  and  the  progress  made  in the implementation  of resolution 
WHA22.39  on the revised  strategy  of malaria  eradication; 
2. APPRECIATES  the active  collaboration  of both  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  in assisting  governments 
in the reviews  of their  malaria  eradication  programmes  ； 
3. EMPHASIZES  the need  to initiate  malaria  control  schemes  within  the general  health  services  where  eradication  is at present  impracticable  and  to increase  the assistance  of WHO  and  other  international  agencies 
to such  schemes  ； 
4. REITERATES  the  need  to intensify  both  fundamental  and  applied  research  for  the  furtherance  of the 
objective  of malaria  eradication; 
5. STRESSES  the  need  for  more  comprehensive  training  of malariologists  in order  to implement  the  new 
strategy  of malaria  eradication  in the context  of countries'  socio-economic  development  plans  ； 
6. URGES  the countries  manufacturing  insecticides  to continue  to make  available  to the developing  countries 
insecticides  for malaria  control  ；  and 
7. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to continue  to keep  the World  Health  Assembly  and  the Executive  Board 
informed  of the development  of the programme  following  the revised  strategy  of malaria  eradication.
