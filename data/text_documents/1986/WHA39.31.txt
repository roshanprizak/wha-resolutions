PREVENTION  AND CONTROL  OF IODINE DEFICIENCY  DISORDERS 
The Thirty-ninth  World Health Assembly, 
Noting the high prevalence  of iodine deficiency  disorders,  affecting  more than 
400 million  people in Asia alone as well as millions  in Africa and South America; 
Concerned  that iodine deficiency  disorders  include  not only goitrous  enlargement  of the 
thyroid gland but also stillbirths,  abortions  and congenital  anomalies；  endemic  cretinism 
characterized  most commonly  by mental deficiency,  deaf mutism and spastic  diplegia  and lesser 
degrees of neurological  defect related  to fetal iodine deficiency;  and impaired  mental 
function  in children  and adults with reduced  levels of circulating  thyroxine； 
Aware that low cost effective  technology,  including  use of iodized  salt and iodized  oil 
(by injection  or mouth),  is available  for the prevention  and control  of iodine deficiency 
disorders; 
Considering  that prevention  and eradication  of iodine deficiency  disorders,  which will 
result in improved  quality  of life, and productivity,  and improved  educability  of children 
and adults suffering  from iodine deficiency  disorders,  is feasible  within the next 5-10 years; 
Aware that the United Nations  Administrative  Committee  on Coordination's  Sub-Committee 
on Nutrition  had called for a global strategy  by governments  and United Nations  agencies  to 
prevent and control  iodine deficiency  disorders;  and that this recommendation  had been 
endorsed  by the Administrative  Committee  on Coordination  for immediate  and high priority 
action;

deficiency  disorders,  wherever  these problems  exist through  appropriate  nutritional 
programmes  as part of primary  health care;

(1) to give all possible  support  to Member States,  as and when requested,  in assessing 
the most appropriate  approaches,  in the light of national  circumstances,  needs and

(2) to collaborate  with Member States in the monitoring  of the incidence  and prevalence 
of iodine deficiency  disorders;

health and development  workers  in the early identification  and treatment  of iodine 
deficiency  disorders  and the implementation  of appropriate  public health preventive
