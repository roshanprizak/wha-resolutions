Intellectual property rights, innovation 
and public health 
 
The Fifty-sixth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on intellectual pr operty rights, innovation and public health;1 
Considering that available data indicates that  of some 1400 new products developed by the 
pharmaceutical industry between 1975 and 1999, only 13  were for tropical diseases and three were for 
tuberculosis; 
Aware that the developed countries represent ne arly 90% of global pharmaceutical sales, 
whereas of the 14 million global deaths due to in fectious diseases, 90% occur in the developing 
countries; 
Concerned about the insufficient research and de velopment in so-called “neglected diseases” 
and “poverty-related diseases”, and noting that r esearch and development in the pharmaceutical sector 
must address public health needs and not only potential market gains; 
Mindful of concerns about the current patent pr otection system, especially as regards access to 
medicines in developing countries; 
Recalling that, in accordance with the Declarati on on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health 
(Doha Declaration), the Agreement on Trade-Relate d Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) 
does not and should not prevent Members from taki ng measures to protect public health and, in 
particular, to promote access to medicines for all; 
Noting that the TRIPS Agreement contains flexibiliti es and that in order to use them adequately, 
Member States need to adapt national patent legislation; 
Reaffirming resolution WHA52.19 on the revised drug strategy, resolution WHA54.11 on WHO 
medicines strategy and resolution WHA55.14 on ensuring accessibility of essential medicines; 
Considering that Member States should urge th e pharmaceutical industry to reinvigorate its 
efforts to develop innovations that add real therap eutic advantage in treating the world’s major killer 
diseases, especially in developing countries;

2 Recognizing the importance of intellectual property rights in fostering research and 
development in innovative medicines and the import ant role played by intellectual property with 
regard to the development of essential medicines; 
Taking into account that in order to tackle new public health problems with international 
impact, such as the emergence of severe acute resp iratory syndrome (SARS), access to new medicines 
with potential therapeutic eff ect, and health innovations and di scoveries should be universally 
available without discrimination; 
Further considering the continuing efforts of WTO Members to reach a solution for paragraph 6 
of the Doha Declaration which recognizes that “W TO Members with insufficient or no manufacturing 
capacities in the pharmaceutical sector could face di fficulties in making effective use of compulsory 
licensing under the TRIPS Agreement”; 
Reasserting the need to accomplish target 7 of M illennium Development Goal 6 and target 17 of 
Millennium Development Goal 8; 
Noting resolutions 2001/33 and 2003/29 of the Commission on Human Rights on access to 
medicines in the context of pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to reaffirm that public health interests are paramount in both pharmaceutical and health 
policies; 
(2) to consider, whenever necessary, adapting na tional legislation in order to use to the full 
the flexibilities contained in the Agreement on Tr ade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights (TRIPS); 
(3) to maintain efforts aimed at reaching, w ithin WTO and before the Fifth WTO Ministerial 
Conference, a consensus solution for paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration, with a view to 
meeting the needs of the developing countries; 
(4) to seek to establish conditions conducive to research and development that spur the 
development of new medicines for diseases that affect developing countries; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to continue to support Member States in the exchange and transfer of technology and 
research findings, according high priority to access to antiretroviral drugs to combat HIV/AIDS 
and medicines to control tuberculosis, malaria a nd other major health problems, in the context 
of paragraph 7 of the Doha Declaration whic h promotes and encourages technology transfer; 
(2) by the time of the 113th session of the Executive Board (January 2004), to establish the 
terms of reference for an appropriate time-limi ted body to collect data and proposals from the 
different actors involved and produce an analysis  of intellectual property rights, innovation, and 
public health, including the question of appropria te funding and incentive mechanisms for the 
creation of new medicines and other products ag ainst diseases that disproportionately affect 
developing countries, and to submit a progress report to the Fifty-seventh World Health   WHA56.27 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  Assembly and a final report with concrete proposals to the Executive Board at its 115th session 
(January 2005); 
(3) to cooperate with Member States, at their request, and with international organizations in 
monitoring and analysing the pharmaceutical an d public health implications of relevant 
international agreements, includi ng trade agreements, so that Member States can effectively 
assess and subsequently develop pharmaceutical and health policies and regulatory measures 
that address their concerns and priorities, and are able to maximize the positive and mitigate the negative impact of those agreements; 
(4) to encourage developed countries to ma ke renewed commitments to investing in 
biomedical and behavioural research, including , where possible, appropriate research with 
developing country partners.
