; (ii) in view of the fact that there is clear evidence that the present available cholera vaccine is of little use in preventing the spread of the disease, to give high priority to long-term programmes aimed at the improvement of water supplies and environmental sanitation and personal hygiene, which will prevent cholera from becoming endemic in newly invaded areas and will ultimately lead to its elimination from endemic foci; (iii) to undertake further studies for the development of more effective methods for prevention and control of cholera, including research on the vaccine prophylaxis and treatment of cholera making use of the experience acquired by countries in this domain; (iv) to undertake a study of the implications of the removal of cholera from the International Health Regulations and to report to the next meeting of the Committee on International Surveillance of Communicable Diseases; and (v) to further strengthen national efforts in the production of rehydration fluids, antibiotics and effective vaccines; 3. INVITES the countries that have the necessary means to contribute to the Voluntary Fund for Health Promotion in order to develop its activities; Noting that some countries imposed an unjustified embargo on the importation of foodstuffs from countries which reported cholera cases; and Taking into account the negative results of multiple and long-term studies on the possibility of importation of cholera by contaminated foodstuffs, CALLS on Member States not to apply such an embargo on the importation of foodstuffs.
