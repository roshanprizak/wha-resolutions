WHA49.3 
Having been informed  that as a result of a payment  received  after the opening of the Forty-ninth  World 
Health Assembly,  the arrears of contributions  of Guatemala  had been reduced to a level below the amount 
which would justify invoking  Article 7 of the Constitution, 
1. EXPRESSES  serious concern at the increasingly  large number of Members  that have been in arrears 
in the payment  of their contributions  in recent years to an extent which would justify invoking  Article 7 of 
the Constitution  and the unprecedented  level of contributions  owed by them; 
2. URGES  the Members  concerned  to regularize  their position at the earliest possible date; 
3. FURTHER  URGES  Members  that have not communicated  their intention  to settle their arrears to do

ninety-ninth  session and after the Members  concerned  have had an opportunity  to explain their situation  to 
the Board, to report to the Fiftieth World Health Assembly  on the status of payment  of contributions; 
6. DECIDES: 
(1) that in accordance  with the statement  of principles  in resolution  WHA41.7  if, by the time of the 
opening of the Fiftieth World Health Assembly,  Burkina Faso, Burundi,  Gambia,  Mauritania,  Togo, 
Uruguay,  and Venezuela  are still in arrears in the payment  of their contributions  to an extent which 
would justify invoking  Article 7 of the Constitution,  their voting privileges  shall be suspended  as from 
the said opening; 
(2) that any suspension  which takes effect as aforesaid  shall continue  at the Fiftieth and subsequent 
Health Assemblies,  until the arrears of the Member concerned  have been reduced to a level below the 
amount which would justify invoking  Article 7 of the Constitution; 
(3) that this decision shall be without prejudice  to the right of any Member  to request restoration  of 
its voting privileges  in accordance  with Article 7 of the Constitution.
