The Fourth World Health Assembly, Having considered a report on the arrears of contributions in respect of the 1948, 1949 and 1950 assessments 1. ' NOTES with satisfaction that certain Members have recently liquidated their arrears in respect to those years ; 2. DRAWS to the attention of Members the fact that : (1) default or delay inpayment of contributions may result in a severe drain on the Working Capital Fund and place undue liability on other Member States ; (2) WHO programmes can be carried out only to the extent that funds are available and that failure of Members to pay their assessed contributions may result in the abandonment or curtailment of certain programmes ; (3) the financial difficulties which beset some Members are appreciated but that the work of the World Health Organization is of worldwide importance and can continue and progress only through the constant support of Members ; 3. REQUESTS all Members : (1) to pay their outstanding contributions in full ; (2) to provide in their national budgets for regular payment of annual contributions to the World Health Organization ; (3) to pay such contributions as early as possible after they are due ; 4. REQUESTS the Executive Board to furnish a complete report to the Fifth World Health Assembly on any Members whose assessments to the 1948, 1949 and 1950 budgets have not been paid at the time of the convening of the Health Assembly, together with recommendations for any action that the Board may consider necessary and appropriate.
