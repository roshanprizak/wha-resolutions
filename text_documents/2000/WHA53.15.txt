FIFTY-THIRD WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA53.15
Agenda item 12.3 20 May 2000
Food safety
The Fifty-third World Health Assembly,
Deeply concerned that foodborne illnesses associated with microbial pathogens, biotoxins and
chemical contaminants in food represent a serious threat to the health of millions of people in the
world;
Recognizing that foodborne diseases significantly affect people’s health and well-being and
have economic consequences for individuals, families, communities, businesses, and countries;
Acknowledging the importance of all services – including public health services – responsible
for food safety, in ensuring the safety of food and in harmonizing the efforts of all stakeholdersthroughout the food chain;
Aware of the increased concern of consumers about the safety of food, particularly after recent
foodborne-disease outbreaks of international and global scope and the emergence of new foodproducts derived from biotechnology;
Recognizing the importance of the standards, guidelines and other recommendations of the
Codex Alimentarius Commission for protecting the health of consumers and assuring fair trading
practices;
Noting the need for surveillance systems for assessment of the burden of foodborne disease and
the development of evidence-based national and international control strategies;
Mindful that food safety systems must take account of the trend towards integration of
agriculture and the food industry and of ensuing changes in farming, production, and marketingpractices and consumer habits in both developed and developing countries;
Mindful of the growing importance of microbiological agents in foodborne-disease outbreaks at
international level and of the increasing resistance of some foodborne bacteria to common therapies,
particularly because of the widespread use of antimicrobials in agriculture and in clinical practice;
Aware of the improvements in public health protection and in the development of sustainable
food and agricultural sectors that could result from the enhancement of WHO’s food safety activities;
Recognizing that developing countries rely for their food supply primarily on traditional
agriculture and small- and medium-sized food industry, and that in most developing countries, the
food safety systems remain weak,WHA53.15
21. URGES Member States:
(1) to integrate food safety as one of their essential public health and public nutrition
functions and to provide adequate resources to establish and strengthen their food safety
programmes in close collaboration with their applied nutrition and epidemiological surveillance
programmes;
(2) to develop and implement systematic and sustainable preventive measures aimed at
reducing significantly the occurrence of foodborne illnesses;
(3) to develop and maintain national, and where appropriate, regional means for surveillance
of foodborne diseases and for monitoring and controlling relevant microorganisms and
chemicals in food; to reinforce the principal responsibility of producers, manufacturers, and
traders for food safety; and to increase the capacity of laboratories, especially in developingcountries;
(4) to integrate measures in their food safety policies aimed at preventing the development of
microbial agents that are resistant to antibiotics;
(5) to support the development of science in the assessment of risks related to food, including
the analysis of risk factors relevant to foodborne disease;
(6) to integrate food safety matters into health and nutrition education and information
programmes for consumers, particularly within primary and secondary school curricula, and toinitiate culture-specific health and nutrition education programmes for food handlers,consumers, farmers, producers and agro-food industry personnel;
(7) to develop outreach programmes for the private sector that can improve food safety at the
consumer level, with emphasis on hazard prevention and orientation for good manufacturingpractices, especially in urban food markets, taking into account the specific needs and
characteristics of micro- and small-food industries, and to explore opportunities for cooperation
with the food industry and consumer associations in order to raise awareness regarding the useof good and ecologically safe farming and good hygienic and manufacturing practices;
(8) to coordinate the food safety activities of all relevant national sectors concerned with food
safety matters, particularly those related to the risk assessment of foodborne hazards, including
the influence of packaging, storage and handling;
(9) to participate actively in the work of the Codex Alimentarius Commission and its
committees, including activities in the emerging area of food-safety risk analysis;
(10) to ensure appropriate, full and accurate disclosure in labelling of food products, including
warnings and best-before dates where relevant;
(11) to legislate for control of the reuse of containers for food products and for the prohibition
of false claims;
2. REQUESTS the Director-General:
(1) to give greater emphasis to food safety, in view of WHO ’s global leadership in public
health, and in collaboration and coordination with other international organizations, notably theWHA53.15
3Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and within the Codex
Alimentarius Commission, and to work towards integrating food safety as one of WHO ’s
essential public health functions, with the goal of developing sustainable, integrated food safety
systems for the reduction of health risk along the entire food chain, from the primary producerto the consumer;
(2) to support Member States in the identification of food-related diseases and the assessment
of foodborne hazards, and storage, packaging and handling issues;
(2 bis) to provide developing countries with support for the training of their staff, taking into
account the technological context of production in these countries;
(3) to focus on emerging problems related to the development of antimicrobial-resistant
microorganisms stemming from the use of antimicrobials in food production and clinicalpractice;
(4) to put in place a global strategy for the surveillance of foodborne diseases and for the
efficient gathering and exchange of information in and between countries and regions, taking
into account the current revision of the International Health Regulations;
(5) to convene, as soon as practicable, an initial strategic planning meeting of food safety
experts from Member States, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizationswith an interest in food safety issues;
(6) to provide, in close collaboration with other international organizations active in this area,
particularly FAO and the International Office of Epizootics (OIE), technical support to
developing countries in assessing the burden on health and prioritizing disease-control strategies
through the development of laboratory-based surveillance systems for major foodborne
pathogens, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, and in monitoring contaminants in food;
(7) in collaboration with FAO and other bodies as appropriate, to strengthen the application
of science in the assessment of acute and long-term health risks related to food, and specifically
to support the establishment of an expert advisory body on microbiological risk assessment and
to strengthen the expert advisory bodies that provide scientific guidance on food safety issuesrelated to chemicals, and to maintain an updated databank of this scientific evidence to supportMember States in making health-related decisions in these matters;
(8) to ensure that the procedures for designating experts and preparing scientific opinions are
such as to guarantee the transparency, excellence and independence of the opinions delivered;
(9) to encourage research to support evidence-based strategies for the control of foodborne
diseases, particularly research on risk factors related to emergence and increase of foodbornediseases and on simple methods for the management and control of health risks related to food;
