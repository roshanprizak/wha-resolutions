The Eleventh World Health Assembly, Recalling that the Sixth World Health Assembly by resolution WHA6.57 decided to consider again, at a future Health Assembly, a number of amendments to the Constitution proposed by the Governments of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, and the consequent transitional arrangements required to provide for the establishment of a system of biennial Health Assemblies setout in Executive Board resolution EB11.R69; Noting that a period of five years has elapsed since the afore-mentioned decision was taken, during which time the Organization has attained a highly satisfactory degree of maturity and stability in its administration and methods of operation; Believing that a system of biennial Health Assemblies would result in a considerable saving of valuable time both of the Secretariat and of the delegates of Member States, in addition to the costs connected with annual Health Assemblies, 1. REQUESTS the Executive Board, in preparing the agenda of the Twelfth World Health Assembly, to include an item " Reconsideration of frequency of World Health Assemblies " ; 2. REQUESTS the Director-General and the Executive Board to study the implications of the adoption of a system of biennial Health Assemblies for the Organization at the present stage of its development and to report thereon to the Twelfth World Health Assembly; and 3. INVITES the attention of Member States to the texts of the proposed amendments and the related transitional and other arrangements necessary to implement a system of biennial Health Assemblies setout in resolution EB11.R69.
