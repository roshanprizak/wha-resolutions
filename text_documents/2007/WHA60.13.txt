Control of leishmaniasis 
 
The Sixtieth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on control of leishmaniasis;1 
Recognizing that leishmaniasis is one of the most neglected tropical diseases, and that more 
than 12 million people worldwide are currently infected, with two million new cases each year; 
Noting with concern that 350 million people are considered at risk and the number of new cases 
is on the increase; 
Recognizing the lack of accurate information on the epidemiology of the disease for better 
understanding of the disease and its control; 
Noting with concern that the disease affects the poorest populations in 88 countries, placing a 
heavy economic burden on families, communities and countries, particularly developing countries; 
Noting the burden that treatment can place on families; Bearing in mind that malnutrition and food insecurity are often identified as major causes of 
disposition to, and severity of, leishmaniasis; 
Acknowledging the significant support extended by Member States and other partners and 
appreciating their continuing cooperation, 
Acknowledging that relevant Member States from the South-East Asia Region have committed 
themselves to collaborate in efforts to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) from the Region by 
2015,

1. URGES Member States where leishmaniasis is a substantial public-health problem: 
(1) to reinforce efforts to set up national control programmes that would draw up guidelines 
and establish systems for surveillance, data collection and analysis;

2 Memorandum of understanding on Elimination of Kala-azar in the South-East Asia Region, 18 May 2005. WHA60.13 
 
 
  
 
 
2 (2) to strengthen prevention, active detection and treatment of cases of both cutaneous and 
visceral leishmaniasis in order to decrease the disease burden;  
(3) to strengthen the capacity of peripheral health centres to deliver primary and secondary 
care,  so that they provide appropriate affordable diagnosis and treatment and act as sentinel 
surveillance sites; 
(4) to conduct epidemiological assessments in order to map foci, and to calculate the real 
impact of leishmaniasis through accurate studies of prevalence and incidence, socioeconomic 
impact and access to prevention and care, and the extent of the disease in those affected by 
malnutrition and HIV; 
(5) to strengthen collaboration between countries that share common foci or disease threats,  
to establish a decentralized structure in areas with major foci of disease, strengthening collaboration between countries that share common foci, increasing the number of WHO 
collaborating centres for leishmaniasis and giving them a greater role, and relying on initiatives 
taken by the various actors  and interagency collaboration at national and international levels in 
all aspects of leishmaniasis control, detection and treatment, with national control programmes 
encouraging these initiatives with the private sector; 
(6) to promote the sustainability of surveillance and leishmaniasis control; 
(6 bis) to improve knowledge about, and skills to prevent, leishmaniasis, and improve 
knowledge about the socioeconomic status of people in rural areas; 
(7) to support studies on the surveillance and control of leishmaniasis; 
(8) to share experiences in the development of studies of, and technologies on, the prevention 
and control of leishmaniasis; 
2. FURTHER URGES Member States: 
(1) to advocate high quality and affordable medicines, and appropriate national drug policies; (2) to encourage research on leishmaniasis control in order: 
(a) to identify appropriate and effective methods of control of  vectors and reservoirs; 
(b) to find alternative safe, effective and affordable medicines for oral, parenteral or 
topical administration involving shorter treatment cycles, less toxicity, and new drug combinations, and to define appropriate doses and duration of therapy schedules for these 
medicines; 
(c) to determine mechanisms to facilitate access to existing control measures, 
including socioeconomic studies and health-sector reform in some developing countries; 
(d) to evaluate and improve sensitivity and specificity of serological diagnostic 
methods for canine and human visceral leishmaniasis, including assessment of 
standardization and effectiveness; 
(e) to evaluate effectiveness of alternative control measures such as use of bednets 
impregnated with long-lasting insecticide;   WHA60.13 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  3. CALLS ON partner bodies to maintain and expand their support for national leishmaniasis 
prevention and control programmes and, as appropriate, to accelerate research on, and development of, leishmaniasis vaccine; 
4. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to raise awareness of the global burden of leishmaniasis, and to promote equitable access 
to health services for prevention and disease management; 
(2) to draft guidelines on prevention and management of leishmaniasis, with emphasis on 
updating the report of WHO’s Expert Committee on Leishmaniasis,
1 with a view to elaborating 
regional plans and fostering the establishment of regional groups of experts; 
(3) to strengthen collaborative efforts among multisectoral stakeholders, interested 
organizations and other bodies in order to support the development and implementation of 
leishmaniasis control programmes; 
(4) to frame a policy for leishmaniasis control, with the technical support of WHO’s Expert 
Advisory Panel on Leishmaniasis; 
(5) to promote research pertaining to leishmaniasis control, including in the areas of safe, 
effective and affordable vaccines, diagnostic tools and medicines with less toxicity as well as dissemination of the findings of that research; notably thorough the UNICEF/UNDP/World 
Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases; 
(6) to monitor progress in the control of leishmaniasis in collaboration with international 
partners,  WHO regional offices and Member States affected by leishmaniasis; 
(7) to report to the Sixty-third World Health Assembly on progress achieved, problems 
encountered and further actions proposed in the implementation of leishmaniasis control 
programmes; 
(8) to promote action with the major laboratories in order to reduce the costs of medicines to 
developing countries; 
(9) to promote and support: 
(a) evaluation of the efficacy of new medicines, 
(b) evaluation of dosage and length of treatment for existing medicines, and 
(c) standardization of diagnostic reagents, in particular for visceral leishmaniasis; 
(10) to facilitate improved coordination among multilateral institutions and international 
donors concerned with leishmaniasis;
