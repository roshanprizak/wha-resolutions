WHA21.10  Tax  Equalization  Plan 
The Twenty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  proposals  of the  Director-General  and  the  recommendation  of the  Executive 
Board  relating  to the  introduction  of a tax  equalization  plan  and  the  establishment  of a tax equalization 
fund,1 
1. DECIDES  THAT 
(1) a tax  equalization  fund  shall  be established  as from  1 January  1969  to which  shall  be credited 
annually  the  revenue  derived  from  the staff  assessment  plan; 
(2) the  credits  to the Fund  shall  be recorded  in sub-accounts  of the Fund,  in the name  of each  Member, 
in the proportion  of its assessment  for the financial  year  concerned; 
(3) there  shall  be charged  against  the  credits  of the  individual  Member  an amount  estimated  to be 
required  to cover  the  annual  liabilities  in respect  of taxes  levied  by that  Member  on staff  members' 
emoluments  received  from  WHO; 
(4) the  amount  credited  to each  Member  in the  Fund  under  paragraph  (2)  above,  less  the amounts 
charged  against  that  credit  under  paragraph  (3) above,  shall  be taken  into  account  in determining  the 
contribution  due  from  the  Member  concerned  for  the same  financial  year; 
(5) adjustments  shall  be made  in the  second  succeeding  financial  year  to take  account  of the actual 
charges  made  in respect  of amounts  reimbursed  to staff  who  are subject  to national  taxes.  Should  such 
charges  exceed  the available  credit  of any  Member,  the excess  shall  be added  to the contribution  of that 
Member  for  the  second  succeeding  year; 
2. DECIDES  further  that  new  Members  joining  the Organization  after  1 January  1969  shall  be assessed  only 
for their  pro rata  share  of the effective  working  budget  for the one  or two  financial  years  prior  to their  assessments  becoming  a part  of the total  assessments  for the annual  budget.
