WHA31.29  Evaluation  of the effects  of biological  environmental  factors  on health 
The Thirty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  WHA29.45  on WHO's  human  health  and  environment  programme  ï¼› 
Noting  resolution  WHA30.47  on the need  for accelerating  and  making  more  effective  the evaluation  of 
health  risks  from  exposure  to chemicals; 
Considering  that  biological  factors  such  as, in particular,  the  spores  of mushrooms  and  other  fungi, 
pollens  and  dusts  of vegetable  or animal  origin  constitute  factors  of aggression  on the health  of all the populations  of the world,  but  that  these  factors  are still  too frequently  little  known,  or else  not known; 
Recognizing  the importance  of the efforts  embarked  upon  by WHO  in the field  of environmental  factors 
and their  effects  on health; 
REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to add  to the list of factors  already  envisaged  the evaluation  of the effects  of biological  factors  on 
health; 
(2) to report  in due  course  to the Executive  Board  and  to the Health  Assembly.
