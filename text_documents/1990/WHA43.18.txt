TROPICAL  DISEASE  RESEARCH 
The Forty-third  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA30.42,  EB71.R10  and EB77.R4; 
Noting the report of the Director-General  on the UNDP/World  Bank/WHO  Special 
Programme  for Research  and Training  in Tropical  Diseases; 
Appreciating  the accomplishments  of the Special  Programme  to date in the development 
and testing  of a number of important  new disease  control  tools, many of which are already 
in operational  use, as well as the innovative  and pioneering  approaches  taken in 
strengthening  research  capability  in developing  countries  where tropical  diseases  are 
endemic； 
Recognizing,  however,  that the target diseases  of the Special  Programme  (malaria, 
schistosomiasis,  filariasis  (including  onchocerciasis),  African  trypanosomiasis,  Chagas 
disease,  leishmaniasis  and leprosy)  continue  to be major public health problems  in many 
tropical  countries,  especially  in the least developed  countries,  not only in rural areas 
but also, increasingly,  in urban areas； 
Aware that in some of these countries,  .notwithstanding  the efforts  that have been 
made, tropical  diseases  and especially  malaria  have continued  to escalate,  to the extent 
that malaria  is once again one of the leading  causes of morbidity； 
Aware that during the next decade further  challenges  need to be addressed  with 
respect to: 
(a) translating  current  advances  in basic biomedical  research  into practical 
disease control  tools, such as recombinant  and synthetic  vaccines； 
(b) increasing  the commitment  of the pharmaceutical  industry  to the development  of 
new drugs and vaccines  for tropical  diseases； 
(c) identifying  strategies  for preventing  the most serious  consequences  of these 
diseases,  such as childhood  mortality  from malaria; 
(d) promoting  applied  research  in economics  and social sciences  to identify  the 
most cost-effective  methods  of utilizing  new tools； 
(e) strengthening  field and operational  research  in the least developed  countries 
in a sustainable  manner : I

1. ENDORSES  the thrusts  and priorities  of the Special  Programme  as adopted  by the Joint 
Coordinating  Board, which focus on: intensified  strategies  for the development  of 
products  in selected  areas, such as new drugs for malaria,  vaccines  for leishmaniasis, 
malaria and schistosomiasis,  and a macrofilaricide  for filariasis；  the implementation  of 
new vector control  methods  for Chagas disease；  operational  research  aimed at optimizing 
multidrug  therapy  for leprosy;  and the use of specific  projects  and research  results  as 
a basis for research  capability  strengthening； 
2. THANKS  the international  community,  multilateral  and bilateral  agencies, 
nongovernmental  organizations,  foundations  and companies  for their support  to the Special 
Programme,  and in particular  UNDP and the World Bank, the co-sponsors  of the Programme, 
and the research  institutions  and scientists  throughout  the world who contribute  their 
talents and skills for the achievement  of the Programme's  objectives; 
3. APPEALS  to the pharmaceutical  industry  to increase  research  and development  in 
tropical  diseases  and to intensify  its collaboration  with the Special  Programme  in the 
development  of new and more effective  tropical  disease  control  tools and in ensuring  that 
these tools are accessible  and affordable  for the populations  affected; 
4. REQUESTS  multilateral  and bilateral  agencies  to place greater  emphasis  on the 
provision  of assistance  both for research  and for control  of tropical  diseases  in endemic 
countries； 
5. ENCOURAGES  biomedical  and social science  research  institutions  to devote greater 
attention  to tropical  diseases  and to establish  appropriate  links among themselves  and 
with tropical  disease  control  programmes  in endemic  countries； 
6. WELCOMES  the Director-General's  decision  to integrate  WHO's various  programmes  for 
the control  of tropical  diseases； 
7. URGES  those Member States in which tropical  diseases  are endemic  to intensify  their 
efforts to control  them by making full use of newly-developed  technology  and developing 
targeted  national  control  strategies,  especially  for the diseases  for which affordable 
and effective  tools are now available； 
8. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to ensure the continuation  of the Special  Programme‘s 
global leadership  role in tropical  disease  research  by: 
(1) strengthening  collaborative  efforts  in academic  and industrial  research  and in 
disease control  activities； 
(2) fostering  further  the commitment  of endemic  countries  to research; 
(3) mobilizing  additional  contributions  to the Special  Programme,  in collaboration 
with UNDP and the World Bank, the со-sponsoring  agencies,  to enable the Programme  to 
achieve its objectives  more rapidly.
