The Forty-first  World Health  Assembly, 
Having considered  the report  of the Director-General"'"  on the work of WHO on 
guidelines  for derived  intervention  levels  concerning  radioactive  contamination  of food; 
Concerned  by the potential  hazards  to health  due to contamination  of the food supply 
with radionuclides； 
Recognizing  the problem  that such contamination  poses to international  trade in 
food; 
Aware that the action  undertaken  by national  authorities  to protect  the public 
following  the serious  nuclear  accident  in 1986 varied  widely  and caused  considerable 
public confusion  and concern; 
Noting that most developing  countries  lack the means necessary  for evaluation  and 
control  of radionuclide  contamination  of their environment  and foodstuffs； 
1. CALLS  UPON Member  States  to utilize  the WHO guidelines  for derived  intervention 
levels regarding  radionuclides  in food when developing  their own plans and procedures  for 
the protection  of public  health  following  accidental  radioactive  contamination  of food 
supplies； 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to continue  to cooperate  with Member  States  in the development  and 
strengthening  of national  capabilities  for the protection  of public  health  following 
radioactive  contamination  of food supplies,  including  the development  of derived 
intervention  levels  regarding  radionuclides  in food on the basis of the 
recommendations  contained  in the WHO guidelines,  and the monitoring  of food 
supplies； 
(2) to provide  support  through  WHO collaborating  centres  to Member  States  in case

(3) to intensify  collaboration  with other relevant  international  organizations  and 
agencies,  such as IAEA, FAO and UNEP, in establishing  capabilities  for the rapid 
exchange  of information  during  emergencies  and for radiation  monitoring  during 
normal and emergency  conditions,  and in harmonizing  approaches  to measure  and 
control  radioactive  contamination  for the protection  of public  health.
