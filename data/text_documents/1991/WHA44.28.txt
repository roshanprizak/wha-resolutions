15 May 1991 
The Forty-fourth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA42.25  and WHA42.26; 
Regretting  that, despite  progress  - especially  within the International  Drinking 
Water Supply and Sanitation  Decade - in increasing  the coverage  of services  to provide 
safe water and appropriate  sanitation,  1200 million  people in the developing  countries 
still do not have access to an adequate  and safe water supply,  and approximately 
1800 million  are without  appropriate  sanitation,  while in developed  countries  the waste 
from millions  of households  is not being properly  disposed  of; 
Emphasizing  the crucial  importance  of safe water and appropriate  sanitation  as an 
essential  element  of primary  health care and a vital requirement  for the prevention  of 
waterborne  diseases,  protection  of human health and the improvement  of the quality  of 
life; 
Recognizing  that, in view of the present  situation  and rapid population  growth, 
particularly  in urban areas, increased  and improved  action is needed; 
Recalling  General  Assembly  resolution  44/228 on the United Nations  Conference  on 
Environment  and Development  (to be held in Rio de Janeiro  in 1992), which identifies  the 
protection  of the quality  and supply of freshwater  resources,  the protection  of human 
health and improvement  of the quality  of life arid the living and working  environment  of 
the poor in urban slums and rural areas, as matters  of major concern  to be considered  by 
the Conference； 
Recalling  the New Delhi Statement  on water supply and sanitation  in the 1990s "Some 
for all, rather than more for some", which was adopted  in September  1990 by 
115 countries； 
Emphasizing  the need for a commitment  by the international  community  to provide  the 
resources  to augment  national  efforts  to achieve  the objective  of safe water and 
appropriate  sanitation  for all people by the year 2000； 
Convinced  that WHO can make a significant  contribution  to the United Nations 
Conference  on Environment  and Development  in 1992 as it has been invited  to do by the 
Preparatory  Committee； 
1. URGES  Member States: 
(1) to reaffirm  the priority  accorded  to programmes  for safe and reliable  water

emphasis  not only on underserved  people in the rural areas but also on the needs of 
the urban poor in the rapidly  growing  urban areas；

the elaboration  of a global water supply and sanitation  action programme  as an input

to be agreed upon at the United Nations  Conference  on Environment  and Development; 
(3) to contribute  to the International  Conference  on Water and the Environment  in 
Dublin in January  1992, this being one part of the preparatory  process  for the 
United Nations  Conference； 
(4) to report to the Forty-fifth  World Health Assembly  on the action taken in 
accordance  with this resolution,  taking into account  the need to develop  WHO's 
updated strategy  for water supply and sanitation  within the framework  of the 
health-for-all  strategy,  as requested  in resolution  WHA42.25. and cost-effective
