WHA20.53  Health  and  Economic  Development 
The Twentieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  that  in many  countries  improvements  in health  conditions  are  not  only  desirable  in themselves, 
but also  essential  for economic  growth  and  therefore  form  an integral  element  of any  meaningful  development 
programme; 
Being  convinced  that  timely  inquiry  into  the  health  problems  which  may  be associated  with  major  development  efforts  and  prompt  arrangements  to avoid  or solve  those  problems  often  result  in important  economies; 
Noting  with  concern  that  the  funds  allocated  to health  projects  within  the  Technical  Assistance  component  of the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  have  continued  to decrease  and  that  the  number  of 
health  projects  in the Special  Fund  component  of that  programme  is inadequate  to help  meet  the  requirements 
for development  which  depend  on the  improvement  of health;  and 
Noting  further  that  health  improvement  is not  progressing  at the  rate  planned  for  this  United  Nations 
Development  Decadc, 
1. CALLS  THE  ATTENTION  of Members  to the  importance  of taking  appropriate  steps  to develop  national 
health  plans  as part  of their  economic  and  social  development  plans; 
2. REITERATES  the  recommendation  that  governments  arrange  appropriate  representation  of  national 
health  authorities  in the  national  bodies  established  to plan  and  co-ordinate  programmes  of economic  and 
social  development; 
3. CONSIDERS  that  governments,  whenever  they  believe  it would  be beneficial,  should  utilize  those  technical 
services  that  are  available  through  the  World  Health  Organization  at its headquarters  and  its regional  offices 
in the  preparation  and  execution  of development  projects; 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to intensify  studies  on the  economic  aspects  of health  activities,  to help 
to strengthen  communication  between  economists  and  public  health  authorities,  and  to accelerate  the  programme  of training  of public  health  administrators  in national  health  planning,  including  health  economics; 
5. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to bring  this  resolution,  and  the  concern  it reflects,  to the  attention  of the 
Secretary-General  of the  United  Nations,  the  Administrator  of the  United  Nations  Development  Programme, 
and the  Governing  Council  for  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme;  and,  further, 
6. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to keep  the  Executive  Board  and  the  World  Health  Assembly  informed 
of progress  made  in the  achievement  of the  objectives  of this  resolution.
