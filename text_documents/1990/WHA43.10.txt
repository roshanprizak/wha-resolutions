Paris  Declaration  on Women,  Children  and  the 
Acquired  Immunodeficiency  Syndrome  (AIDS) 
The International  Conference  on the Implications  of AIDS  for Mothers  and  Children  was 
held in Paris  from  27 to 30 November  1989,  to hear  scientific  presentations  and  to 
discuss  the policy  implications  of human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  infection  for these 
important  population  groups.  Based  on the discussions  and  findings  from  the Conference, 
the assembled  Ministers  of Health  and  their  representatives  declare: 
Considering  the  extensive  scientific  and  psychosocial  implications  presented  by HIV 
infection/AIDS  in women,  children  and  families,  and  bearing  in mind  the need  to 
consider  the  problems  of AIDS  in mothers  and  children  in the  light  of a broad 
approach  to the health  of women,  children  and  families  and  the goal  of Health  for All 
by the Year  2000; 
Recognizing  that  the AIDS  pandemic  一 closely  associated  with  problems  of drug  abuse  一 
has a particularly  adverse  effect  on women  and  children,  and  that  they  are both 
increasingly  exposed  to the risk  of HIV  infection  and  also  suffer  extensively  from  the 
social  and  economic  impact  of HIV  infection/AIDS; 
Recognizing  that  the deterioration  of the economic  situation  in many  countries  adversely 
affects  the health  and  social  status  of populations,  and  in particular,  that  of women 
and children; 
Recalling  the  recent  adoption  of the  Convention  on the  Rights  of the  Child,  the 
resolutions  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly,  the World  Health  Assembly,  and 
the London  Declaration  of January  1988  on AIDS  prevention  and,  in particular,  the 
need  to respect  the  human  rights  and  dignity  of people  infected  with  HIV,  their 
families  and  those  with  whom  they  live; 
Acknowledging  the  leading  role  of the World  Health  Organization  in the guidance  and 
coordination  of AIDS  education,  prevention,  control  and  research  and  noting  with 
appreciation  the  efforts  of the  World  Health  Organization/United  Nations 
Development  Programme  Alliance,  United  Nations  Population  Fund,  United  Nations 
Children's  Fund,  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization 
and other  intergovernmental  organizations  in contributing  to the implementation  of 
the Global  AIDS  Strategy; 
Emphasizing  the  efforts  of national  AIDS  programmes  and  the role  of governments, 
nongovernmental  and  voluntary  organizations,  and  the public  and  private  sectors  in 
implementing  the Global  AIDS  Strategy  at all levels; 
Considering  that  the  prevention  and  control  of HIV/AIDS  for women  and  children 
requires  strengthening  and  improving  the primary  health  care  system,  education,  and 
other  psychological  and  social  support  programmes  for women,  children  and  families; 
Therefore,  given  the urgent  need  to promote  and  protect  the health  of women,  children 
and families,  we appeal  to all governments,  the United  Nations  system,  within  which 
the World  Health  Organization  has  the  responsibility  of directing  and  coordinating 
the global  fight  against  AIDS,  intergovernmental  and  nongovernmental  organizations, 
the scientific  community,  health  and  social  professionals  and  the public  at large: 
1. To assume  leadership  and  to mobilize  the  necessary  resources,  both  human  and 
financial,  to actively  support  the  prevention  and  care  of HIV  infection/AIDS  in 
women  and  children,  particularly  in those  countries  that  are most  affected  and  wkh 
the greatest  economic  need,  and  in conformity  with  the Global  AIDS  Strategy. 
2. To enhance  the  role  of and  the  social  economic  and  legal  status  of women  and 
children;  to ensure  full participation  of women  in AIDS  programmes  at all levels;  and

are HIV-infected. 
3. To further  develop  and  implement  innovative,  multi-faceted  health  education 
programmes  for prevention  of HIV  infection/AIDS.  Information  and  education 
programmes  for and  by young  people,  including  adolescents,  should  emphasize  their 
responsibilities  to prevent  the spread  of infection  to themselves  and  in their  role  as 
future  parents. 
4. To emphasize  the need  to prevent  stigma  tiza tion and  discrimination  against  people 
with  HIV  infection/AIDS  and  those  at risk,  in all areas  of life and  for all services, 
including  school. 
5. To ensure  adequate  recognition  of the problem  of AIDS  and  HIV  infection  for all 
affected  populations  by  developing  and  maintaining  effective  national 
epidemiological  surveillance  and  case  reporting  systems. 
6. To ensure  that  the HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  control  programmes  be coordinated  or 
integrated  with  all other  programmes  for women,  children  and  families,  particularly 
maternal  and  child  health,  family  planning  and  sexually  transmitted  disease  control 
programmes  and  to review  and  strengthen  the policies  and  management  of the health 
and other  social  services  with  due  consideration  to women's  perspectives. 
7. To ensure  that  HIV  testing  is offered  to women  and  children  as an integral  but 
voluntary  part  of health  programmes,  including  counselling  and  other  psychosocial 
support,  with  due  respect  to confidentiality. 
8. To promote  safe  motherhood  for all women  and  ensure  that  HIV-infected  women 
receive  appropriate  information  and  have  access  to health  services,  including  family 
planning,  counselling  and  other  psychosocial  support  so that  they  can  personally 
make  informed  decisions  about  childbearing. 
9. To ensure  that  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  control  programmes  provide  necessary 
support  for families  affected  by HIV/AIDS  by mobilizing  health  and  social  services  to 
respond  to emerging  needs,  including  for families  that  suffer  discrimination,  that  are 
not able  to provide  child  care,  or for those  children  who  are abandoned  or orphaned. 
10. To emphasize  availability  of and  access  to necessary  health  care,  including  treatment, 
and to other  social  and  support  services  for HIV-infected  women  and  children,

of appropriate  screening  tests  and  indications  for transfusion. 
13. To recognize  the  close  link  between  HIV  infection/AIDS  and  drug  abuse,  which 
increases  the risk  of HIV  transmission,  and  to assure  availability  of comprehensive 
health  care,  including  drug  abuse  treatment  and  prevention  programmes  to minimize 
the risk  of HIV  infection  of men,  women  and  unborn  children  by this  route. 
14. To ensure  that  appropriate  priorities  and  resources  are devoted  to research  on HIV 
infection/AIDS  in women,  children  and  families,  and  develop  joint  research 
programmes,  including  programmes  on prevention,  diagnosis,  treatment,  medical 
care and  the broader  related  issues  affecting  health  and  social  conditions  of women 
and children.  The  research  should  also  focus  on the  alternative  approaches  to 
providing  health  and  other  social  services  for HIV  affected  women,  children  and 
families. 
To recognize  the crucial  role  of women  in the Global  AIDS  Strategy  and  to accelerate 
the process  of empowerment  of women  against  AIDS.
