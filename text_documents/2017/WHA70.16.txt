 
  SEVENTIETH  WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY  WHA 70.16 
Agenda item 14.2  31 May 2017 
Global vector control response : an integrated 
approach for  the control of vector -borne diseases  
The Seventieth  World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on global vector control response;1 
Appreciating the work of the Secretariat in developing , through broad consultation with 
Member States and members of the global health community , a comprehensive globa l vector control 
response 2017–2030,2 which served as the basis for the report;1 
Acutely aware of the burden and threat of vector -borne diseases t o individuals, families and 
societies throughout the world, and the influence of social, demographic and environmental factors, 
including climate change and other climate - and weather -related factors, and increasing vector 
resistance to insecticides and th e spread of mosquitoes and other vectors to unaffected areas;  
Recognizing the need for cooperation to prevent, detect, report on and respond to outbreaks of 
vector -borne diseases so as to avoid a public health emergency of international concern under the 
International Health Regulations (2005);  
Noting the recent gains that have been made against malaria, onchocerciasis, lymphatic 
filariasis, Chagas disease and others, as well as previous failures and existing challenges, and that 
lessons learned could be us ed for other vector -borne diseases;  
Recognizing the need for an integrated, comprehensive approach to vector control that will 
enable the setting and achievement of disease- specific national and global goals, and that will 
contribute to the attainment of t he Sustainable Development Goals, to addressing the social 
determinants of health and to tackling health inequities;  
Deeply concerned by the current limited capacity and capability for vector control globally, and 
in particular the acute shortage in public  health and development programmes of personnel with skills 
in public health entomology,  
1. WELCOMES the strategic approach for integrated global vector control and response, as 
articulated in the report and its Annex ;

2. URGES Member States:1 
(1) to develop or adapt, as appropriate, existing national vector control strategies and 
operational plans to align them to the strategic approach for integrated global vector control and 
response, as summarized in the report ,2 and consistent with the Internation al Health  
Regulations (2005);  
(2) to build and sustain, as appropriate, adequate human- resource ( especially public health 
entomology), infrastructural and institutional capacity and capability at all levels of government 
and across all relevant sectors, b ased on a vector control needs assessment;  
(3) to promote basic research on vectors and their transmission of pathogens, and applied 
research on vector control tools, including biological tools , technologies and approaches to 
evaluate their impact on disease, socioeconomic development, human populations and the environment ; and to assess how to integrate them with vaccines, med icines and other 
interventions;  
(4) to promote collaboration in line with the “ One Health ” approach  and the integrated vector 
and communicable disease approach , as appropriate , across all levels and sectors of 
government , including municipality and local administrative structures, and with the 
engagement and mobilization of communities through organized stakeholder groups;  
(5) to stren gthen national and subnational capacity, as appropriate, for vector surveillance , 
forecasting  and intervention monitoring, including for vector pesticide resistance, and the 
impact of pesticides on environmental and human health, and to integrate them with  public 
health surveillance systems;  
(6) to strengthen and engage in cross- border and regional collaboration by means that include 
networks in line with the International Health Regulations (2005) in order to build adequate capacity for prevention, surveil lance, control and response for vector -borne diseases;  
(7) to collaborate , as appropriate, with international, regional, national and local institutions 
and non- State actors from  relevant sectors to support and contribute to the implementation of 
WHO’s str ategic approach for integrated global vector control and response ; 
3. REQUESTS the Director -General:  
(1) to continue to develop and disseminate normative guidance, policy advice and 
implementation guidance that provides support to Member States
1 to reduce the burden and 
threat of vector -borne diseases, including to strengthen human -resource capacity and capability 
for effective locally adapted sustainable and ethically sensitive vector control;  
1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations.

(2) to continue to promote research on vector -borne disease systems and development of 
innovative products, methods, tools, technologies and approaches , and to support the generation 
of evidence -based knowledge on their  safety, efficacy and impact on disease, socioeconomic 
development, human populations and the natura l environment;  
(3) to review and provide technical guidance on the ethical aspects and issues associated with 
the implementation of new vector control approaches in order to develop mitigating strategies 
and solutions;  
(4) to undertake a review of the ethical aspects and related issues associated with vector 
control implementation  that will  include  social determinants of health, in order to develop 
mitigating strategies and solutio ns to tackle health inequities;  
(5) to disseminate widely , and update as appropriate , technical guidance on integrated vector 
control for all relevant vector -borne diseases, especially as new evidence- based knowledge  
becomes available for improved and novel products, tool s, technologies and approaches;  
(6) to strengthen the capacities and capabilities of the Secretariat at the global, regional and 
country levels and ensure that all relevant parts of the Organization across all three levels are 
actively engaged to lead a coordinated global effort that includes collaboration with other bodies  
of the United Nations system and other intergovernmental agencies for better implementation of 
vector control;  
(7) to develop, in consultation with Member States and through regional committees , as 
appropriate, regional action plans aligned wi th WHO ’s technical guidance on vector control , 
including the priority activities as described in the report;1 
(8) to provide support to countries to develop and/or update national vector control and 
vector -borne disease control strategies aligned to the st rategic approach for integrated global 
vector control and response  and, as appropriate, to other ongoing communicable disease control 
strategies and emergency responses to outbreaks;  
(9) to monitor the implementation of the strategic approach for integrated global vector 
control and response , and report back on its impact and the progress made towards the 
milestones and targets at the Seventy -fifth, Eightieth and Eighty- fifth World Health Assemblies.
