The Forty-seventh  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA41.17,  WHA43.20  and WHA45.30; 
Noting the continued  need to improve the quality of drug promotion  through the use of the concepts 
embodied  in the WHO Ethical  Criteria for Medicinal  Drug Promotion; 
Having considered  the report of the Director-General1  on the outcome  of the CIOMS/WHO 
Consultation  on the WHO Ethical  Criteria, 
1. THANKS  the Council  for International  Organizations  of Medical  Sciences  (CIOMS)  for having 
convened  the consultation  in collaboration  with WHO, and for the valuable  report adopted by consensus 
and which covers a wide range of issues and the action to be taken; 
2. APPRECIATES  the commitment  of the participants  - drug regulatory  authorities,  pharmaceutical 
manufacturers  and distributors,  health professionals,  universities  and teaching  institutions,  professional 
associations,  patient and consumer  groups,  and the professional  and general  media - to a common 
responsibility,  based on fundamental  ethical principles,  for the well-being  of patients  individually  and the 
public collectively; 
3. ENDORSES  the report of the consultation  and reaffirms: 
(1) that the regulation  of drugs must ensure not only the safety, efficacy and quality of drugs but 
also the accuracy  of the information  provided  pursuant  to their regulation; 
(2) that patients,  pharmacists  and prescribers  should have access to appropriate  and understandable 
information  about drugs and their side-effects; 
(3) that the promotion  of drugs must be accurate,  fair and objective,  and presented  in such a way 
as to conform  to legal requirements  and also to high ethical standards; 
(4) that promotional  claims should not be stronger  than valid, up-to-date  scientific  evidence 
warrants,  every effort being made to avoid ambiguity;
