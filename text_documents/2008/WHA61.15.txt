Global immunization strategy 
 
The Sixty-first World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on the global immunization strategy;1 
Applauding the remarkable investments in human and financial resources made by Member 
States and partner agencies in support of vaccines and immunization as well as the launch of 
innovative financing mechanisms such as the Interna tional Finance Facility for Immunization, and the 
advance market commitment for a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine through the GAVI Alliance; 
Recognizing the immense contribution that immu nization has made to the control of the 
common communicable diseases in the countries where it has been effectively applied; 
Recognizing that continued efforts are also requi red to strengthen surveillance of communicable 
diseases and ensure the quality of the production,  management and administration of vaccines; 
Recalling resolution WHA56.20 on reducing global measles mortality, and commending 
Member States’ and their partners’ success in exceedi ng the goal of reducing deaths worldwide due to 
measles by 50% by the end of 2005 compared with the 1999 level; 
Commending also Member States’ and their pa rtners’ progress in increasing the availability, 
affordability and uptake of he patitis B vaccine worldwide; 
Recognizing the availability of new and underutilized  vaccines that could have significant 
impact on the health of the peoples of the world,  including the achievement of the health-related  
Millennium Development Goals;  
Encouraged by the progress in mole cular biology and genetics that is  accelerating the discovery 
and development of new vaccines and by the incr easing number of developing-country manufacturers 
producing vaccines that meet WHO requirements for vaccines of assured quality; 
Concerned that many developing countries are not  on track to meet the internationally agreed  
targets in the health-related Millennium Development Goals,  particularly the target  of reducing the 
under-five mortality rate;

2 Concerned that there are insufficient res ources available for introduction of new and 
underutilized vaccines, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, and given the costs 
related to procurement and introduction of these vacci nes, and taking into account the need to expand 
the number of manufacturers, particularly in deve loping countries, that can produce to the standards 
required to attain and maintain WHO-prequalifi cation and to create a co mpetitive market place for 
these vaccines; 
Stressing the vital role that vaccine and immunization programmes can play in reducing 
under-five  mortality and in facilitating the delivery of  a package of life-saving interventions, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to review national st rategy and programme perform ance, to identify areas for 
improvement and to implement fully the strategy  for reducing measles mortality in order to 
achieve the goal set in the Global Immuniza tion Vision and Strategy 2006–2015 of a 90% 
reduction in the global measles morta lity rate between 2000 and 2010; 
(2) to enhance efforts to improve delivery of  high-quality immunization services in order to 
achieve the target of equitable coverage of at l east 80% in all districts by 2010 set in the Global 
Immunization Vision and Strategy 2006–2015; 
(3) to stimulate rapid introduction and uptake of life-saving vaccines into national 
immunization schedules in accordance with national priorities and to expa nd coverage of these 
vaccines in order to accelerate the achievement of the health-related Millennium Development 
Goals; 
(4) to further expand access to, and coverage of, av ailable, affordable and cost-effective new 
life-saving vaccines of assured quality and desi red efficacy, while maintaining efforts to 
strengthen regular vaccination programmes in accordance with the burden of disease and national priorities, for all target populations in or der to accelerate the achie vement of the healthrelated Millennium Development Goals, and to promote and strengthen long-term financial and 
programmatic sustainability; 
(5) to develop, strengthen and/or maintain surv eillance systems for vaccine-related adverse 
events, linked with systems for monitoring compliance with safe injection practices; 
(6) to strengthen efforts to protect, promote and support early and effective breastfeeding, in 
order to boost the development of infants’ overall immune systems; 
(7) to strengthen surveillance systems for vacci ne-preventable diseases and monitoring of 
vaccination programmes;
 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to work and increase collaboration  with Member States in order  to sustain political 
commitment at all levels for achieving high immuni zation coverage rates with all available costeffective vaccines; 
(2) to collaborate with international partners and intergovernmental partners in order to 
provide technical support to expand the number of  manufacturers, particularly in developing   WHA61.15 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  countries, that can meet the standards required to attain and maintain WHO-prequalification 
standards; 
(3) to collaborate with international partners,  intergovernmental partners and donors as well 
as vaccine producers to mobilize necessary resour ces to support low-income and middle-income 
countries with the aim of increasing the supply of affordable vaccines of assured quality; 
(4) to work with UNICEF and the GAVI Allian ce to build on existing international efforts 
and partnerships and facilita te the development of a consensus among developing and 
developed countries for meeting the financial gaps and other requir ements for the attainment of 
the health-related Millennium Devel opment Goals through immunization; 
(5) to take measures, as appropriate, to assi st developing countries to establish and strengthen 
their capacity for vaccine research, development and regulation, for the purpose of improving 
the output of vaccine production with the aim of increasing the supply of affordable vaccines of 
assured quality; 
(6) to provide guidelines and technical suppor t to Member States in order to establish 
integrated surveillance of a dverse events following immunization and to minimize unnecessary 
vaccine-related adverse events; 
(7) to facilitate scientific, technical and financial investments in the research and 
development of safe and effective vaccines ag ainst poverty-related and neglected diseases; 
(8) to monitor progress towards achievement of  global immunization goals and report on 
such progress to the Sixty-fourth World Health Assembly; 
(9) to accelerate the implementation of the globa l framework for vaccine-preventable disease 
surveillance and immunization programme mo nitoring, through the gathering of the 
comprehensive epidemiological data required to guide immunization programmes, and to 
strengthen national capacity for making evidence-ba sed policy decisions to adopt new vaccines.
