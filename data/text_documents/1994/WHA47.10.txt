FORTY-SEVENTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA47.10 
Agenda  item  19 10  May  1994 
Maternal  and child  health  and family  planning: 
traditional  practices  harmful  to the health  of women 
and children 
The Forty-seventh  World Health Assembly, 
Noting the report by the Director-General  on maternal  and child health and family planning:  current 
needs and f√ºture orientation; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA32.42  on maternal  and child health, including  family planning;  WHA38.22 
on maturity  before childbearing  and promotion  of responsible  parenthood;  and WHA46.18  on maternal 
and child health and family planning  for health; 
Reaffirming  its support for the United Nations Convention  on the Rights of the Child, and United 
Nations Economic  and Social Council resolution  1992/251  on traditional  practices  affecting  the health of 
women and children; 
Recognizing  that, although  some traditional  practices  may be beneficial  or harmless,  others, 
particularly  those relating to female genital mutilation  and early sexual relations  and reproduction,  cause 
serious problems  in pregnancy  and childbirth  and have a profound  effect on the health and development 
of children,  including  child care and feeding,  creating  risks of rickets and anaemia; 
Acknowledging  the important  role that nongovernmental  organizations  have played in bringing  these 
matters to the attention  of their social, political  and religious  leaders,  and in establishing  programmes  for 
the abolition  of many of these practices,  particularly  female genital mutilation, 
1. WELCOMES  the initiative  taken by the Director-General  in drawing international  attention  to these 
matters in relation to health and human rights in the context of a comprehensive  approach  to women's 
health in all countries,  and the policy declarations  to the United Nations Special Rapporteur  on traditional 
practices  by governments  in countries  where female genital mutilation  is practised; 
2. URGES  all Member  States: 
(1) to assess the extent to which harmful  traditional  practices  affecting  the health of women and 
children constitute  a social and public health problem  in any local community  or sub-group; 
(2) to establish  national  policies and programmes  that will effectively,  and with legal instruments, 
abolish female genital mutilation,  childbearing  before biological  and social maturity,  and other 
harmful practices  affecting  the health of women and children; 
(3) to collaborate  with national  nongovernmental  groups active in this field, draw upon their 
experience  and expertise  and, where such groups do not exist, encourage  their establishment; 
WHA47.10 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to strengthen  WHO's technical  support to and cooperation  with Member  States in implementing 
the measures  specified  above; 
(2) to continue  global and regional  collaboration  with the networks  of nongovernmental 
organizations,  United Nations  bodies, and other agencies  and organizations  concerned  in order to 
establish national,  regional  and global strategies  for the abolition  of harmful traditional  practices; 
(3) to mobilize  additional  extrabudgetary  resources  in order to sustain the action at national, 
regional and global levels.
