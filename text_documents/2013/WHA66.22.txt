Agenda item  17.2  27 May 2013 
Follow up of the report of the Consultative Expert 
Working Group on Research and Development: 
Financing and Coordination  
 
The Sixty -sixth  World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report of the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and 
Development: Financing and Coordination;1 
Recalling resolution WHA65.22, which requested the Director -General, inter alia, to hold an 
open- ended meeting of Member States that would thoroughly analyse the report and the feasibility of 
the recommendations proposed by the Consultative Expert Working Group, and taking into account 
discussions during regional committee meetin gs and regional and national consultations;  
Further recalling the global strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and 
intellectual property and its aims to promote innovation, build capacity, improve access and mobilize 
resources to address  diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries as well as resolutions 
WHA59.24, WHA63.21 and WHA63.28;  
Recognizing the urgency in addressing the health needs of developing countries and the related 
inequities in the current research landscap e due to recognized market failures and the need for 
enhancing investments in health research and development related to Type II and Type III diseases and the specific research and development needs of developing countries in relation to Type I diseases;  
Acknowledging the need for improving monitoring of health research and development resource 
flows, and identification of gaps in health research and development , better coordination of health 
research and development , and priority- setting based on the publi c health needs of developing 
countries;  
Acknowledging also that the provision of additional information on disease burden, research 
opportunities, and the potential health impact  of new health products , as well as an estimation of the 
resources needed to develop new health products  and make them accessible to the poor in developing 
countries, can provide an important basis for advocacy for additional financing;  
Recognizing the importance of securing sus tainable financing mechanisms for health research 
and development in order to develop and deliver health products  that address the health needs of 
developing countries;

2 Recalling the global strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and intel lectual 
property, which refers to a range of incentive schemes for health research and development , with one 
objective being the de -linkage of the cost of research and development from the price of health 
products;  
Recognizing the interlinkage of monitoring, coordination and financing of health research and 
development as well as the importance of predictability and sustainability of the resources required to 
enhance health research and development ; 
Reaffirming the importance of facilitation of technology t ransfer on mutually agreed terms 
between developed and developing countries as well as among developing countries as appropriate;  
Underscoring that health research and development should be needs -driven and evidence -based, 
and be guided by the following core principles: affordability, effectiveness, efficiency and equity; and 
it should be considered as a shared responsibility;  
Realizing the need for improving priority -setting and transparent decision -making processes 
based on the public health needs of deve loping countries;  
Noting the important role of the public and private sectors in promoting innovation and 
developing new health products,  
1. ENDORSES the following strategic workplan to improve monitoring and coordination, and to 
ensure sustainable funding  for health research and development , in line with the global strategy and 
plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property, as a step towards achieving the 
goal of development and delivery of affordable, effective, safe and quality he alth products for which 
existing market mechanisms fail to provide incentives for health research and development ; and 
agreeing to develop the strategic workplan further, through the broad engagement of public and private 
entities, academia and civil society;  
2. URGES Member States: 1 
(1) to strengthen health research and development  capacities, increasing investments in 
health research and development  for diseases disproportionately affecting developing countries;  
(2) to promote capacity building, transfer  of technology on mutually agreed terms, 
manufacture of health products in developing countries, and health research and development and access to health products in developing countries through investments and sustainable 
collaboration;  
(3) to establish o r strengthen national health research and development observatories or 
equivalent functions for tracking and monitoring of relevant information on health research and 
development, in line with agreed norms and standards as established in subparagraph 4(1) below, and to contribute to the work of a global health research and development observatory;  
(4) to promote coordination of health research and development at national, regional and 
global levels in order to maximize synergies;  
                                                      
1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations.    WHA66 .22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  3 (5) to identify projects, a s part of the strategic workplan, through regional consultations and 
broad engagement of relevant stakeholders, to address research gaps, ensure effective 
coordination at all levels, and secure resource needs for implementation in order to develop and 
deliver health products;  
(6) to continue consultation, at national as well as at regional and global levels, including 
through the governing bodies of WHO, on specific aspects related to coordination, priority 
setting and financing of health research and devel opment ;

development , through voluntary contributions for activities at country, regional and global 
levels, in particular for monitoring, including a global healt h research and development 
observatory;
