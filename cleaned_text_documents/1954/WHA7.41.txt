The Seventh World Health Assembly, Noting that the amount of Technical Assistance funds expected tobe made available to the Organization from year to year is subject to fluctuations resulting from the voluntary nature of contributions ; Believing that the financial problems which have been encountered in the past will continue to arise until such time as the financial arrangements governing the Technical Assistance programme are placed on the basis of beginning projects only when funds are in hand to assure their completion ; Considering that the fluctuations from year to year in the amount of Technical Assistance funds made available to WHO disrupt planned programmes under all resources of the Organization, are inimical to the steady planning and implementation of individual projects, and retard the approved general programme of work fora specific period ; 1. REQUESTS the Director-General to do everything possible to develop the programmes financed from the regular budget of WHO and from Technical Assistance funds in such away as to separate them as completely as possible1 in order that adjustments inone programme will not necessitate consequential adjustments in the other programme ; 2. REQUESTS the Director-General, to the extent practicable, to include in the estimates of expenditure from Technical Assistance funds provisions for the fellowship requirements of appropriate individual projects (including individual fellowships), irrespective of the source from which other costs relating to such projects be financed, subject to the consent of the governments and the approval of the Technical Assistance Board ; 3. AUTHORIZES the Director-General to implement the programme in priorities (categories of urgency) as proposed by him and to the extent of available resources ; 4. AUTHORIZES the Executive Board to acton behalf of the World Health Assembly in connexion with any aspect of this programme, including any necessary modification thereof, in order to adjust it to the amount of funds made available ; 5. REQUESTS the Executive Board to report to the Eighth World Health Assembly on any such modification made ; and 6. AUTHORIZES the Director-General to continue to take the action necessary for WHO to participate in the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance. Handb. Res., 2nd ed., 3 Adopted at the tenth plenary meeting, 20 May 1954 (section 7 of the fourth report of the Committee on Programme and Budget)
