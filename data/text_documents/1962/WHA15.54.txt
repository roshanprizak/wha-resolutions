WHA15.54  Developments  in Activities  assisted  jointly  with  UNICEF 
The Fifteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the  Director-General  on developments  in activities  assisted  jointly 
with  UNICEF; 
Recognizing  the  invaluable  contribution  that  UNICEF  is making  towards  the  success  of the  health 
programmes  for  mothers  and  children, 
1. NOTES  the report  of the Director-General; 
2. EXPRESSES  to the UNICEF  Executive  Board  its appreciation  of its decision  to maintain  the $10  million 
per year  ceiling  for allocations  for  malaria  programmes; 
3. EXPRESSES  the hope  that,  in view  of the deleterious  impact  that  smallpox  has  on the health  of mothers 
and children,  UNICEF  will  find  it possible  to give  full support  to the smallpox  eradication  programme  being 
sponsored  by the  World  Health  Organization; 
4. BELIEVES  that  nutritional  problems  should  always  be considered  in the context  of all other  aspects  of 
health  which  are  so intimately  related  to them;  and  therefore 
5. RECOMMENDS  that  activities  dealing  with  the medical  aspects  of nutrition  be as fully  integrated  as possible 
with  other  health  activities,  particularly  health  education,  environmental  sanitation  and  the control  of communicable  diseases,  as well  as with  maternal  and  child  and  school  health  services;  and 
6. EXPRESSES  its satisfaction  with  the  close  and  efficient  co-operation  between  the  two  organizations  in 
assisting  countries  in combating  communicable  diseases,  promoting  higher  standards  of nutrition  and  environmental  sanitation,  the training  of national  staff,  as well  as in the more  specific  promotion  of maternal 
and child  health.
