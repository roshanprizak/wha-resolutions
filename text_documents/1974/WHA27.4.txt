deduction  of the following: 
(i) Reimbursement  from  the United  Nations  Development  Programme  in the estimated 
amount  of US  $2 000  000

contributions  to be paid  by individual  Members,  their  assessments  shall  be reduced  further  by the 
amount  standing  to their  credit  in the Tax  Equalization  Fund,  except  that  the  credits  of those  Members that  require  staff  members  of WHO  to pay  taxes  on their  WHO  emoluments  shall  be reduced  by the 
estimated  amounts  of such  tax reimbursements  to be made  by the Organization."
