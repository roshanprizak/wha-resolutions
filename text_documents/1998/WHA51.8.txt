particularly affect civilian populations and are uniquely tragic, so that they deserve special attention;
Recalling the Ottawa Declaration of 5 October 1996, the Brussels Declaration of 27 June 1997, and noting
the progress made by the international community towards a global ban on anti-personnel mines, as well as therelevant decisions and initiatives taken in other forums;
Recalling Article 6 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockp iling, Production and Transfer
of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, adopted in Oslo on 18 September 1997, and opened forsignature on 3 December 1997, which provides that assistance for the care and rehabilitation of mine victims andfor mine awareness programmes may be provided, inter alia, through the United Nations system, international,
regional or national organizations or institutions;
Recalling operative paragraph C.2 of resolution EB95.R17 on emergency and humanitarian action, which
requests the Director-General “to advocate the protection of non-combatants and the setting-up of effective
treatment and rehabilitation programmes for the victims of anti-personnel landmines, as well as the systematicmanagement of delayed health effects of mental and physical injuries in situations of collective violence”;
Recognizing the serious consequences for health caused by anti-personnel mines as they, inter alia, limit
population mobility, prevent access to arable land, resulting in malnutrition, hamper access to health services,
contribute to the spread of communicable diseases like poliomyelitis and hinder their eradication, and, lastly,generate significant psychosocial disorders;
Recognizing that a total ban on anti-pers onnel mines will be an important contribution to global public
health;
Welcoming the participation of over 120 Member States in the Ottawa Treaty Signing Ceremony from 3

anti-personnel mines by developing public health programmes for anti-personnel-mine injury prevention andcontrol,WHA51.8
