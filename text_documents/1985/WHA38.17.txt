the problems  facing countries; 
Recalling  resolution  39/210 of the United Nations  General  Assembly  deploring  the fact

restrictions,  blockades,  embargoes  and other sanctions；

security  of all peoples,  as set out in the WHO Constitution;

development  of the health programmes  of any Member State； 
3. DEPLORES  the application  by any country  of measures  of this kind against  any other 
country or countries；

and offsetting  the unfavourable  effects  on health.
