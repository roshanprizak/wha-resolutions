WHA3.52 Léon  Bernard  Foundation  : Amendment  of Statutes 
Considering  that  Article  1 of the Statutes  of the Léon  Bernard  Foundation  03  provides  for the election 
for a period  of five  years  of five  experts  in social  medicine  who  shall  form  the Léon  Bernard  Foundation 
Committee  ; 
Considering  that  the cost  of convening  this  committee,  which  would  have  to be met  out of the funds  of 
the Foundation,  would  seriously  prejudice  its objects, 
The Third  World  Health  Assembly 
1. RESOLVES  that  Article  1 of the Statutes  of the Léon  Bernard  Foundation  be amended  as follows  : 
Article  1 
A committee  styled  the  " Léon  Bernard  Foundation  Committee  " shall  be formed  and  shall  be 
composed  of the following  members  : the Chairman  and  Vice-Chairmen  of the Executive  Board  as such, 
and two  persons  serving  on the Executive  Board  elected  by the Board  for a period  not  exceeding  their 
term  of office  on the Board. 
The Director-General  of the World  Health  Organization  shall  act as Administrator  of the Foundation 
and as Secretary  of the committee. 
2. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  to establish  a Léon  Bernard  Foundation  committee  in accordance  with  the 
Statutes  of the Foundation  as revised.  This  committee  shall  propose  to the Fourth  World  Health  Assembly 
the award  of the prize  to the candidate  selected  by it.
