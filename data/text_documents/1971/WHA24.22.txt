forward  at that  time  by the  Director-General,  and  the Board's  recommendations  thereon  as contained  in 
resolutions  EB47.R32  and  EB47.R33; 
Recognizing  the  now  urgent  need  for  additional  temporary  office  space  at headquarters  pending  the 
construction  of a permanent  extension  to the  headquarters  building;  and 
Recognizing  also  the need  to make  provision  for additional  parking  space  in a manner  which  will  not 
detract  seriously  from  the appearance  of the headquarters  building, 
1. AUTHORIZES,  in accordance  with  the terms  of resolution  WHA23.14,  the  construction  of an additional 
temporary  office  building  as proposed  by the  Director-General  at an estimated  cost  of approximately 
US $600  000 to be financed  from  the Real  Estate  Fund; 
2. AUTHORIZES  the  Director-General  : 
(a) to undertake  the construction  of an additional  underground  parking  garage  as proposed  at a cost 
not exceeding  US$1  100  000; 
(b) to obtain  the necessary  loans  to finance  this  construction  according  to the plan  proposed  by him, 
such  loans  to be repaid  by rental  revenue  from  the existing  and  proposed  garages; 
(c) during  the  first  half  of the  amortization  period  of the  garage  loan,  to meet  from  casual 
income  accrued  as at the end  of the previous  financial  year  the  difference  between  rental  income  and 
amortization  payments  plus  interest,  such  expenditure  by the Organization  being  recovered  from  rental 
revenue  in the second  half  of the amortization  period,  after  which  the full  amount  of the garage  rentals 
will represent  an additional  source  of casual  income  available  to the Organization;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to report  further  to the Executive  Board  at its forty-ninth  session  and  to 
the Twenty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly:
