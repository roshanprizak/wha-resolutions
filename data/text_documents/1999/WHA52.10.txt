FIFTY-SECOND WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA52.10
Agenda item 13 24 May 1999
Smallpox eradication:  destruction of
variola virus stocks
The Fifty-second World Health Assembly,
Recalling  that resolution WHA49.10 recommended that the remaining stocks of variola virus should be
destroyed on 30 June 1999 after a final decision had been taken by the Health Assembly;
Havi ng considered the report of the Secretariat on destruction of the variola virus stocks, as well as th e
report of the January 1999 meeting of the WHO ad hoc Committee on Orthopox Virus Infections;
Affirming that the final eliminati on of all variola virus remains the goal of the World Health Organization
and all Member States;
Noting that rece nt scientific reviews of the smallpox issue have presented arguments that retention of the
variola virus stocks for  the present would permit research for public health purposes, including the development
of antiviral agents as well as an improved and safer vaccine;
Having  noted a lack of consensus among Member States as to whether the Assembly should proceed to
authorize destruction of the variola virus stocks on 30 June 1999, as proposed by the Assembly in 1996,
1. STRONGLY REAFFIRMS the decision of previous A ssemblies that the remaining stocks of variola virus
should be destroyed;
2. DECIDES to auth orize temporary retention up to not later than 2002 and subject to annual review by the
World Health Assembly of the existing stocks of variola virus at the current locations - the Centers for Disease
Control and P revention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America, and the Russian State Centre for Research
on Virolog y and Biotechnology, Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Region, Russian Federation - for the purpose of further
international research into antiviral agents and improved vaccines, and to permit high-priority investigations of
the genetic structure and pathogenesis of smallpox;
3. FURTHER  DECIDES that any such research shall be funded by Member States or by other national or
international bodies and shall be conducted in an o pen and transparent manner only with the agreement and under
the control of WHO;WHA52.10
24. REQUESTS the Director-General:
(1) to appoint a new group o f experts which will establish what research, if any, must be carried out in
order to reach global consensus  on the timing for the destruction of existing variola virus stocks, and will:
(a) advise WHO on all actions to be taken with respect to variola;
(b) develop a research plan for priority work on the variola virus;
(c) devise a mechanism for reporting of research results to the world health community;
(d) outline  an inspection schedule to confirm the strict containment of existing stocks and t o
assure a safe and secure research environment for work on the variola virus, and mak e
recommendations on these points;
(2) to facilita te the full participation in the work of the new group of experts of a limited number o f
scientists and public health experts from Member States of each of the WHO regions;
(3) to report the initial recommendati ons and plans of the group of experts, including relevant costs for
WHO, to the Executive Board  at its 106th session in May 2000, providing that external funding has been
made available for this purpose;
(4) to present a detailed report, including progress of the research programme on the smallpox virus,
to the Executive Board and Health Assembly as so on as possible, but in any event not later than 2002, and
to make recommend ations to the Executive Board and Health Assembly regarding their proposals for the
date of final destruction of the remaining stocks of variola virus.
