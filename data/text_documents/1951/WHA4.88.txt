WHA4.88  Earthquake  in El Salvador 
The Fourth  World  Health  Assembly,  considering  that  the World  Health  Organization  was  founded 
on principles  of solidarity  and  universal  aid,  and  that  the  recent  earthquake  in El Salvador  had  caused 
considerable  loss  of human  life  and  rendered  great  numbers  homeless,  as well  as depriving  them  of many 
health  benefits,  sent  to the Government  and  people  of El Salvador  its deepest  sympathy  and  hopes  for a 
speedy  re-establishment  of normal  conditions,  and  stood  in silence  for one  minute  to pay  tribute  to the 
victims  of the  catastrophe.
