WHA17.43  Smallpox  Eradication  Programme 
The Seventeenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the  Director-General  2 on the  present  situation  of smallpox  in the 
world  and  on the  progress  so far achieved  towards  the  eradication  of the  disease  from  endemic  areas; 
Noting  that  the  Expert  Committee  on Smallpox  which  met  in January  1964: 
(a) recommended  that  in each  smallpox  eradication  campaign  a comprehensive  plan  of action  must 
be prepared  and  that  its aim  should  be to cover  100  per  cent,  of the  population,  and  that  special 
attention  should  be paid  to the  age-groups  in which  the  disease  most  frequently  occurs,  as shown  by 
the analyses  of age-specific  attack  rates,  and  to new-born  children  and  pregnant  women  in whom  the 
mortality  is very  high;  and 
(b) considered  that  the  use  of freeze-dried  vaccine  is absolutely  essential  in hot  climates  and  under 
conditions  of difficult  communications,  especially  for adequate  revaccination; 
Recognizing  that,  in order  to ensure  the  success  of the programme,  sufficient  quantities  of potent  freezedried  vaccine  and  freeze-drying  equipment  should  be made  available  as necessary  to countries  in endemic 
areas  developing  eradication  programmes; 
Noting  that,  while  some  countries  have  taken  commendable  steps  to eradicate  smallpox,  many  others 
are hampered  in their  efforts  by lack  of material  support,  particularly  freeze-dried  vaccine  and  other 
imported  supplies  and  transport; 
Noting  with  appreciation  the  donations  of freeze-dried  vaccine  to the Organization  by the Governments 
of the Netherlands,  Switzerland,  the  Union  of Soviet  Socialist  Republics,  and  the  United  Kingdom  of Great 
Britain  and  Northern  Ireland;  and 
Recognizing  that  the  need  for  freeze-dried  vaccine  for  eradication  programmes  during  the  next  two 
years  is of the  order  of two  hundred  million  doses, 
1. URGES  those  countries  where  the  disease  is still  present,  and  which  have  not  initiated  eradication  programmes,  to plan  and  implement  as soon  as possible  programmes  of eradication  following  the recommendations  of the  Expert  Committee  on Smallpox; 
2. INVITES  countries  able  to do so to contribute  to the  programmes  by making  substantial  voluntary 
contributions  in cash  or kind  to enable  the Organization  to provide  freeze-dried  vaccine  and  other  necessary 
materials  and  equipment  to countries  with  sound  eradication  programmes  requesting  such  assistance;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to  prepare  a further  comprehensive  plan  for the world-wide  eradication  of smallpox; 
(2) to  provide,  under  the  future  regular  programme  and  budget  of the Organization—if  necessary  at 
the expense  of lower-priority  activities—for  making  good  the  shortfall  of the  vaccine  required,  and 
of other  essential  supplies  and  equipment,  to countries  developing  eradication  programmes;  and 
(3) to  report  on the programme  at future  sessions  of the Executive  Board  and  of the Health  Assembly.
