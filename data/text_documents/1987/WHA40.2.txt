STATUS OF COLLECTION  OF ASSESSED  CONTRIBUTIONS 
AND STATUS OF ADVANCES  TO THE WORKING  CAPITAL  FUND 
The Fortieth  World Health Assembly, 
Noting with concern  that as at 31 December  1986; 
(a) the rate of collection  of contributions  in respect  of the effective  working 
budget amounted  to 72.18%,  being the lowest rate since the year 1950; and 
(b) only 83 Members  had paid their current  year contributions  to the effective 
working budget in full, and 45 Members  had made no payment  towards  their current  year 
contributions； 
1. EXPRESSES  concern  at Uhe alarming  deterioration  in the payment  of contributions  in 1986, 
which is already  having a deleterious  effect on programme  implementation  during the current 
financial  period; 
2. CALLS  THE ATTENTION  of all Members  to the importance  of paying their full contributions  as 
early as possible  in the year to which they relate,  so that the Director-General  might cancel 
planned contingent  programme  budget implementation  reductions; 
3. REQUESTS  Members  that have not yet done so to provide  in their national  budgets  for the 
payment to the World Health Organization  of their contributions  when due, in accordance  with 
Financial  Regulation  5.6, which provides  that instalments  of contributions  and advances  shall 
be considered  as due and payable  in full by the first day of the year to which they relate; 
4e URGES  Members  that systematically  make a practice  of late payment  of contributions  to take 
whatever  steps may be necessary  to ensure earlier  payment ； 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General 
all Members• to draw the contents  of this resolution  to the attention  of 
Eleventh  plenary  meeting,  13 May 1987
