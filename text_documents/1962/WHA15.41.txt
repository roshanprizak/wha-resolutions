WHA15.41  Clinical  and  Pharmacological  Evaluation  of Drugs 
The Fifteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that 
(1) new  pharmaceutical  preparations  appear  in a steadily  increasing  number  on the  market; 
(2) in many  of these  preparations  a great  therapeutic  activity  may  be combined  with  serious  sideeffects  demanding  particular  care  in administration; 
(3) recent  experience  has  shown  certain  defects  in existing  safety  control  measures; 
(4) these  defects  are especially  related  to insufficient  clinical  trials; 
(5) clinical  evaluation  represents  the  final  assessment  of pharmaceutical  preparations  and  is the 
principal  means  of detecting  harmful  side-effects  following  long-term  use; 
(6) clinical  trials  are  highly  time-consuming,  need  very  large  numbers  of patients  to be observed 
according  to generally  accepted  principles,  and  would  often  be facilitated  by international  co-operation; 
(7) it should  be the  responsibility  of national  health  authorities  to ensure  that  the  pharmaceutical 
preparations  available  to the  medical  profession  are therapeutically  efficient  and  that  their  potential 
dangers  are  fully  recognized, 
1. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to pursue,  with  the assistance  of the Advisory  Committee  on Medical 
Research,  the study  of the scientific  aspects  of the clinical  and  pharmacological  evaluation  of pharmaceutical 
preparations  ; 
2. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  and  the Director-General  to study  the feasibility  or otherwise,  on the 
part of WHO,  of 
(a) establishing  minimum  basic  requirements  and  recommending  standard  methods  for  the clinical 
and pharmacological  evaluation  of pharmaceutical  preparations; 
(b) securing  regular  exchange  of information  on the  safety  and  efficacy  of pharmaceutical  preparations;  and,  in particular, 
(c) securing  prompt  transmission  to national  health  authorities  of new  information  on serious 
side-effects  of pharmaceutical  preparations, 
and to report  to the Sixteenth  World  Health  Assembly  on the progress  of this  study.
