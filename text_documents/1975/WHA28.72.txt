blood  transfusion  services  based  on voluntary  nonremunerated  donations; 
Being  aware  of the higher  risk  of transmitting  diseases  when  blood  products  have  been  obtained  from 
paid  rather  than  from  voluntary  donors,  and  of the harmful  consequences  to the  health  of donors  of too 
frequent  blood  donations  (one  of the causes  being  remuneration),
