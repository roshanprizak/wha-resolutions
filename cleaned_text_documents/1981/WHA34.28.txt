Periodicity of Health Assemblies The Thirty-fourth World Health Assembly, Recalling the resolution WHA12.38 which affirms that "notwithstanding any savings that might accrue, it would not be opportune, at a time when the Organization is expanding and its activities developing, to reduce the number of occasions upon which the World Health Assembly would have the opportunity to direct and control such expansion and activities" Having in mind the need to preserve and strengthen the democratic participation of all Member States in the work of the Organization; Having considered the views expressed by the Regional Committees, the discussions in the sixty-seventh session of the Executive Board and the Director-General's report on the periodicity and duration of Health Assemblies Recognizing that the implementation of the plan of action consequent upon the study of the structure of the Organization in the light of its functions is still incomplete; Keeping in mind, at all times, the collective commitment of all countries to achieve the goal of Health for All by the Year 2000 and the consequential necessity of further strengthening the role of the Assembly as the highest forum of the Organization; Taking into account the positive experience of the long-time practice of annual Assemblies and realizing that any change in the current system and change over from annual to biennial Assemblies without accompanying consequential arrangements as regards the composition and the size of the Executive Board and in the role and function of all bodies of the Organization shall have adverse implications for the attainment of regional and global commitments besides reflecting upon effective fulfilment of the constitutional functions of the Assembly;. 1. CONSIDERS that a change in the periodicity of World Health Assemblies should only take place in connexion with other structural reforms, such as changes of the Executive Board and in the role and function of all bodies in the composition and size of the Organization; 2. RESOLVES to retain the practice of annual Assemblies for the time being. Sixteenth Plenary Meeting, 22 May 1981 A34 / VR / 16 Document EB67 / l981 / kEc / l, Annex 13.
