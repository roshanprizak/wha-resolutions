WHA24.12 Review  of method  of establishment  of scale  of assessment 
The Twenty-fourth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  noted  a report  by the Executive  Board  on the method  of establishment  of the scale  of assessment 
of the World  Health  Organization;  and 
Considering  that  the World  Health  Assembly  in its resolution  WHA8.5  had  expressed  the opinion  that 
the latest  available  United  Nations  scale  should  be used  as a basis  of determining  the scale  of assessment  to 
be used  by WHO,  taking  account  of: 
(a) the  difference  in membership;  and 
(b) the  establishment  of minima  and  maxima,  including  the provision  that  no country  shall  be required 
to pay  more  per capita  than  the per capita  contribution  of the highest  contributor, 
DECIDES: 
(1) that  the latest  available  United  Nations  scale  of assessment  shall  be used  as a basis  of determining 
the WHO  scale  of assessment,  taking  account  of: 
(a) the  difference  in membership;  and 
(b) the  establishment  of minima  and  maxima,  including  the provision  that  no country  shall  be 
required  to pay  more  per capita  than  the per capita  contribution  of the highest  contributor; 
(2) that,  in principle,  the  maximum  contribution  of any  one  Member  State  in the  WHO  scale 
of assessment  shall  not  exceed  30 % of the total  and  that  this  objective  shall  be reached  gradually, 
as and when  the assessment  of the highest  contributor  is reduced  in the United  Nations  scale;  in addition, 
as States  which  are not  Members  of the United  Nations  are  admitted  to membership  of WHO,  the 
maximum  assessment  percentage  in the WHO  scale  shall  be reduced  by its proportionate  share  of such 
new Members'  assessment  percentages  ; the implementation  of the procedure  contained  in this  paragraph 
shall  not in any  case  increase  the percentage  assessment  of Members;  and 
(3) that  the maximum  assessment  shall  be calculated  as a percentage  of the total  assessments  of the 
Members  actively  participating  in the work  of the Organization.
