involved and produce an analysis of intellectual property rights, innovation and public health; 
Further recalling resolutions W HA52.19, WHA53.14, WHA54.10, and WHA57.14; 
Having considered the report of the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and 
Public Health;1  
Conscious of the growing burden of diseases and conditions disproportionately affecting 
developing countries, particularly those affecting women and children, including an upsurge in 
noncommunicable diseases; 
Considering the need to continue  to develop safe and affordable new products2 for such 
communicable diseases as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and for other diseases or illnesses disproportionately affecting developing countries;  
Conscious of the opportunities opened up by advances in biomedical science, and the need to 
harness them more effectively to develop new products, particularly in order to meet public health 
needs in developing countries; 
Aware of the considerable progress that has been made in recent years by governments, 
industry, charitable foundations, and nongovernmental organizations in funding initiatives to develop 
new products to fight diseases affecting developing countries, and to increase access to existing ones; 
Recognizing, however, that much more needs to be done in relation to the scale of avoidable 
suffering and mortality; 
Concerned about the need for appropriate, effectiv e and safe health tools for patients living in 
resource-poor settings; 
Considering the urgency of devel oping new products to address emerging health threats such as 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases of particular  relevance to developing 
countries;

Recognizing the importance of, and need for, public/private partnerships devoted to the 
development of new essential drugs and research tools, and aware of  the need for governments to set a 
needs-based priority agenda for health, and to provide political support and sustainable sources of 
funding for such initiatives; 
Recognizing the importance of public and priv ate investment in the development of new 
medical technologies; 
Considering that a number of developing countries have been strengthening their research and 
development capacity in new health technologies and that their role will be increasingly critical, and recognizing the need for continued support for research in and by developing countries; 
Noting that intellectual property rights are an important incentive for the development of new 
health-care products; 
Noting, however, that this incentive alone does not meet the need for the development of new 
products to fight diseases where the potential paying market is small or uncertain; 
Noting that the Doha Ministerial Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health 
confirms that the Agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to 
protect public health; 
Further noting that the Declaration, while reiterating commitment to the Agreement on Trade 
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) affirms that the Agreement can and should be 
interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of the rights of WTO Members to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all; 
Taking into account Article 7 of the TRIPS agreement that states that “the protection and 
enforcement of intellectual property rights should contribute to the promotion of technological 
innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of  technology, to the mutual advantage of producers 
and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations”; 
Stressing that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that “everyone has the right 
freely to participate in the cultural life of the commu nity, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific 
advancement and its benefits” and that “everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and 
material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author”; 
Concerned about the impact of high prices of medicines on access to treatment; Aware of the need to promote new thinking on the mechanisms that support in novation; 
Recognizing the importance of strengthening capacity of local public institutions and businesses 
in developing countries to contribute to, and participate in, research and development efforts; 
Noting that the report of the Commission requests WHO to prepare a global plan of action to 
secure enhanced and sustainable funding for developing and making accessible products to address 
diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries,
