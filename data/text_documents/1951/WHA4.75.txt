WHA4.75  Adoption  of the  International  Sanitary  Regulations  (WHO  Regulations  No.  2) 
The Fourth  World  Health  Assembly 
1. ADOPTS  as WHO  Regulations  No.  2 the International  Sanitary  Regulations,57  together  with  : 
Appendices  1 to 6, concerning  the forms  and  certificates,  and  rules  applying  thereto  ; 
Annex  A, concerning  the sanitary  control  of pilgrim  traffic  approaching  or leaving  the Hedjaz  during 
the season  of the Pilgrimage  ; 
Annex  B, concerning  the standards  of hygiene  on pilgrim  ships  and  on aircraft  carrying  pilgrims  ; 
Considering  that  the provisions  of Annex  A are of a transitional  nature,  applicable  only  until  such 
time  as the  health  administration  for Saudi  Arabia  is fully  equipped  to deal  with  all sanitary  problems 
connected  with  the pilgrimage  within  its territory, 
2. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  to keep  the situation  continuously  under  review  in this  respect  and  to 
recommend  to the Health  Assembly  such  modification  in the provisions  or in the applicability  of Annex  A 
as it deems  appropriate  ; and 
Considering  further  that  the provisions  of Annex  B extend  beyond  the strict  limits  of hygiene  and  that 
certain  of these  provisions  might  be appropriately  dealt  with  by an international  organization  competent 
in maritime  questions, 
3. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  to consult  with  the Inter-Governmental  Maritime  Consultative  Organization,  when  the latter  is fully  constituted,  with  a view  to sharing  the responsibility  in this  field. 
(Presented  by  the  Committee  on  International
