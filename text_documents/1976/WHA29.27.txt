WHA29.27  Review  of the Working  Capital  Fund 
The Twenty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the recommendations  of the Executive  Board  1 on the Working  Capital  Fund, 
1. AUTHORIZES  the Director-General  to borrow  cash  set aside  for payment  of unliquidated  obligations  in 
respect  of prior  years  and  other  funds  not used  for the financing  of programme  activities,  provided  that: 
(1) cash  is borrowed  only  upon  depletion  of the cash  balance  of the Working  Capital  Fund  and  when 
necessary  to maintain  the level  of activities  included  in the regular  programme  budget  pending  the receipt 
of contributions; 
(2) internal  borrowings  are  limited  to cash  set aside  to meet  unliquidated  obligations  in respect  of 
prior  financial  periods  and  other  funds  not used  for the financing  of programme  activities  ； 
(3) such  funds  are borrowed  only  if they  are not  immediately  required  for their  designated  purposes; 
(4) repayment  of any  such  loans  is a first  priority  charge  on contributions  received; 
(5) any  balances  of such  internal  loans  outstanding  at the end  of the financial  period  are reported  to 
the Executive  Board; 
2. CALLS  UPON  all Members  and  Associate  Members  to take  the necessary  steps  to ensure  that  their  annual 
contributions  are paid  in full  and  as early  in the year  as possible  in order  to avoid  depletion  of the Working 
Capital  Fund,  thus  precluding  the necessity  of borrowing  from  other  funds; 
3. DECIDES  to amend  Financial  Regulations  5.1  and  6.3  to read  as follows: 
“ 5.1 The  appropriations,  subject  to the  adjustments  effected  in accordance  with  the  provisions  of 
regulation  5.2，shall  be financed  by contributions  from  Members,  according  to the scale  of assessments 
determined  by the Health  Assembly.  Pending  the receipt  of such  contributions,  the appropriations  may 
be financed  from  the Working  Capital  Fund  or, if the cash  balance  of the Working  Capital  Fund  is 
inadequate  for such  interim  financing,  by internal  borrowing  from  other  available  cash  resources  of the 
Organization,  excluding  Trust  Funds.  Any  balances  of such  internal  loans  outstanding  at the end  of 
the financial  period  shall  be reported  to the Executive  Board.“ 
“ 6.3 Amounts  borrowed  internally  or advances  made  from  the  Working  Capital  Fund  to finance 
budgetary  appropriations  during  a financial  period  shall  be reimbursed  as soon  as and  to the extent  that 
income  is available  for  that  purpose,  first  priority  being  accorded  to reimbursement  of internal 
borrowings.  ’，
