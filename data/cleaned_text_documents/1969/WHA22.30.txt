The Twenty-second World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Director-General1 on the fluoridation of water supplies, presented inaccordance with resolution EB43.R10 of the Executive Board; Bearing in mind that dental caries is a widespread disease in many populations, and is becoming increasingly prevalent in many others Recalling that studies in several countries have consistently shown the prevalence of this disease tobe markedly low whenever an optimal concentration of fluoride occurs naturally in water supplies; Accepting the reports now coming from countries with experience of the procedure indicating that the adjustment of the fluoride content of water supplies to an optimal level is a practicable, safe and efficient public health measure; Noting that other equally effective means are not available for conferring on whole populations the beneficial effects of fluoride on dental health Emphasizing that in the extensive scientific literature on the subject no valid evidence has been forthcoming of any ill effects on human health from the use of water supplies with an optimal concentration of fluoride; Recognizing that several authoritative and independent inquiries conducted in a number of countries have all reached conclusions similar to the above; and Recognizing further that for many populations the provision of potable water supplies is a first consideration, 1. THANKS the Director-General for his report; 2. RECOMMENDS Member States to examine the possibility of introducing and, where practicable, to introduce fluoridation of those community water supplies where the fluoride intake from water and other sources for the given population is below optimal levels, as a proven public health measure; and where fluoridation of community water supplies is not practicable, to study other methods of using fluorides for the protection of dental health 3. REQUESTS the Director-General to continue to encourage research into the etiology of dental caries, the fluoride content of diets, the mechanism of action of fluoride at optimal concentrations in drinking-water, and the effects of greatly excessive intake of fluoride from natural sources, and to report thereon to the World Health Assembly; and 4. REQUESTS the Director-General to bring this resolution to the attention of all Member States. Handb.
