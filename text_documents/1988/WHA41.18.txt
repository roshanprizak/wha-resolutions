ANNEX 
CERTIFICATION  SCHEME ON THE QUALITY  OF PHARMACEUTICAL  PRODUCTS 
MOVING IN INTERNATIONAL  COMMERCE 
Part I - Certification  of a Pharmaceutical  Product 
1. For the purpose  of this Certification  Scheme "pharmaceutical  product"  means any 
medicine  intended  for human use, or a veterinary  product  administered  to food-producing 
animals,  presented  in its finished  dosage form or as a starting  material  for use in such 
a dosage form, when it is subject  to control  by legislation  in the exporting  Member State 
and in the importing  Member State. It should be noted that, as a matter of policy,  some 
Member States do not inspect  manufacturers  of starting  materials,  while in other 
countries  such inspection  is limited  to selected  active ingredients. 
2. A pharmaceutical  product  exported  or imported  under this Certification  Scheme 
would be certified  by the competent  authority  of the exporting  Member State on a 
Certificate  of a Pharmaceutical  Product,  issued at the request  of the interested  party, 
to be sent to the competent  authority  of the importing  Member State, which would decide 
to grant or to refuse the authorization  for sale or distribution  of the certified 
product,  or to make the authorization  conditional  on the submission  of supplementary 
data. 
3. The issue of the Certificate  of a Pharmaceutical  Product  would be subject  to 
the conditions  required  by the competent  authority  of the exporting  Member State in order 
to certify  that: 
(a) the product  is authorized  for sale or distribution  within the exporting  Member 
State (if not, the reasons  therefore  would be stated on the certificate)；  and 
(b) the manufacturing  plant in which the product  is produced  is subject  to 
inspection  at suitable  intervals  to show that the manufacturer  conforms  to 
requirements  for good practices  in manufacture  and quality  control,  as recommended 
by the World Health Organization,  in respect  of products  to be sold or distributed 
within the country  of origin or to be exported. 
A suggested  layout of a Certificate  of a Pharmaceutical  Product  with explanatory 
notes is attached. 
4. Certification  of individual  batches  of pharmaceutical  products  and substances 
is only undertaken  exceptionally  by the competent  authorities  of Member States.  Even 
then, it is rarely applied  other than to vaccines  and other biologicals.  If certificates 
of individual  batches  of a product  covered  by a Certificate  of a Pharmaceutical  Product 
are required,  such certificates  could be issued either by the manufacturer  or by the 
competent  authority  of the exporting  Member State, according  to the nature of the product 
and the requirements  of the exporting  Member State or of the importing  Member State. The 
batch certificate  would indicate  the name and dosage form of the product,  the batch 
number, the expiry date and storage  conditions,  a reference  to the Certificate  of a 
Pharmaceutical  Product,  and a statement  that the batch conforms  either to the 
requirements  of the competent  authority  for sale or distribution  within the exporting 
Member State (with reference  to the authorization)  or, as the case may be, to published 
specifications,  or to established  specifications  to be provided  by the manufacturer.  The 
certificate  could also include  data on packaging,  labelling,  nature of the container,  the 
date of manufacture,  results  of analysis  and on stability,  and other information  such as 
an approved  technical  summary  of the data regarding  safety and efficacy  on which the 
domestic  marketing  authorization  is based.

Part II - Exchange  of Information 
、十! Ù'-V.  •；г f； ；：. ‘：  . .： ‘ •  •'  . 
1. Upon the request  of the competent  authority  of the Member State into which a 
pharmaceutical  product  covered  by this Certification  Scheme is to be or has been 
imported,  the^ competent  authority  of the exporting  Member State should provide  : 
(a) information  on the implementation  of the Requirements  for Good Practices  in the 
Manufacture  and Quality  Control  of Drugs as recommended  by the World Health 
Organization; 
(b) information  on controls  of the product  as exercised  by the competent  authority 
of the exporting  Member State； 
(c) the names and functions  of the persons  designated  to sign certificates  of 
individual  batches  of the product  to be exported; 
(d) copies  of all information  and labelling  supplied  with the product,  as provided 
on packaging  materials  and package  inserts,  and whether  directed  to the prescriber 
or the patient,  that have been approved  by the competent  authority  in the exporting 
Member State, together  with the date(s)  on which such approval  was accorded. 
Information  on general  and specific  standards  for quality  control  of the product  to 
be exported,  in so far as they are required  to comply with legislative  provisions  of the 
importing  Member State, could also be supplied  with the consent  of the manufacturer. 
2. In the case of quality  defects  of products  imported  under this Certification 
Scheme that are considered  to be of a serious  nature by the importing  country,  not 
attributable  to local conditions  and circumstances,  and appearing  after the introduction 
of a particular  batch into the importing  Member State, the competent  authority  should 
notify the occurrence,  together  with the relevant  facts, to the competent  authority  of 
the exporting  Member State that had issued the Certificate  for the product  concerned, 
with a request  to institute  inquiries.  Conversely,  if the competent  authority  of the 
exporting  Member State ascertains  serious  quality  defects,  that competent  authority 
should notify the competent  authority  of the importing  Member State. 
Part III - Participating  Member States 
1. Each Member State agreeing  to participate  in the Certification  Scheme shall 
communicate  (a) the name and address  of its principal  authority  to be considered  as 
competent  within the meaning  of the Certification  Scheme,  and (b) any significant 
reservations  relating  to its participation,  to the Director-General  of the World Health 
Organization,  who would notify all other Member States. 
2. Exporting  Member States participating  in the Certification  Scheme shall ensure 
that: 
(a) authorization  for sale or distribution  of pharmaceutical  products  is subject  to 
appropriate  testing  measures,  by the competent  authority,  designed  to ensure their 
quality and stability,  and that adequate  laboratory  facilities  are available  for 
this purpose； 
1 It is realized  that in some countries  this may require  the consent  of the 
manufacturer. 
Annex 
(b) the pharmaceutical  industry  is obliged  to conform  to requirements  for good 
practices  in the manufacture  and quality  control  of drugs as recommended  by the 
World Health Organization; 
(c) the competent  authority  is empowered  to conduct  appropriate  investigations  to 
ensure that manufacturers  conform  to the requirements  referred  to in (b), including, 
for example,  the examination  of records  and the taking of samples； 
(d) the inspectors  in the services  of its competent  authority  have appropriate 
qualifications  and experience. 
3. Exporting  Member States participating  in the Certification  Scheme should, 
whenever  possible,  ensure that the international  nonproprietary  names, whenever 
available,  are used in the description  of the composition  of the product  on the 
Certificates  and, as far as possible,  appear on the labelling  of pharmaceutical  products 
to be exported  under the Certification  Scheme.

Explanatory  Notes 
Certificate  of a Pharmaceutical  Product 
This certificate  is intended  to define the status of the pharmaceutical  product  and 
its manufacturer  in the exporting  country.  It is issued by the competent  authority  in 
the exporting  country  in accordance  with the requirements  of the competent  authority  of 
the importing  country.  It may be required  by the importing  country  at the time of the 
first importation  and subsequently  if confirmation  or updating  is required. 
The requirements  for good practices  in the manufacture  and quality  control  of drugs 
mentioned  in the certificate  refer to the text adopted  by the Twenty-eighth  World Health 
Assembly  in its resolution  WHA28.65  (see WHO Official  Records,  No. 226, 1975, Annex 12, 
Part 1). 
The certificate  is intended  to be product  specific.  The approved  information 
for different  dosage forms of the same active substance  frequently  differs  in fundamental 
aspects.  Confusion  will inevitably  arise if information  relating  to different  products, 
or even different  dosage forms, is attached  to the same certificate. 
2 
Use, whenever  possible,  international  nonproprietary  names (INNs) or national 
nonproprietary  names. 
Annex 
Batch certificates 
Certification  of individual  batches  of a pharmaceutical  product  or substance  is only 
undertaken  exceptionally  by the competent  authorities  of Member States.  Even then, it is 
rarely applied  other than to vaccines  and other biologicals.  If certificates  of 
individual  batches  of products  covered  by a Certificate  of a Pharmaceutical  Product  is 
required,  such certificates  could be issued either by the manufacturer  or by the 
competent  authority  of the exporting  Member State, according  to the nature of the product 
and the requirements  of the exporting  Member State or of the importing  Member State. The 
batch certificate  would indicate  the name and dosage form of the product,  the batch 
number, the expiry date and storage  conditions,  a reference  to the Certificate  of a 
Pharmaceutical  Product  and a statement  that the batch conforms  either to the requirements 
of the competent  authority  for sale or distribution  within the exporting  Member State 
(with reference  to the authorization)  or, where appropriate,  to published  specifications 
or to established  specifications  to be provided  by the manufacturer.  The certificate 
could also include  data on packaging,  labelling,  nature of the container,  the date of 
manufacture,  results  of analysis,  stability  data and other information  such as an 
approved  technical  summary  of the data regarding  safety and efficacy  on which the 
domestic  marketing  authorization  is based.
