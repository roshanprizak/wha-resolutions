WHA25.55  Prevention  of blindness 
The Twenty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  WHA22.29  on the prevention  of blindness  adopted  by the Twenty-second  World 
Health  Assembly; 
Having  considered  the  report  of the Director-General  on the prevention  of blindness; 
Being  aware  of the complexity  of the  problem  and  of the  relatively  limited  information  available  on 
blindness  and  its causes  throughout  the  world;  and 
Noting  with  interest  the activities  already  undertaken  by WHO  in this  field  as well  as the provision  made 
for a study  group  on the  prevention  of blindness  to be convened  in 1972, 
1. NOTES  the report  of the Director-General  with  appreciation  ； 
2. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  : 
(1) to  endeavour  to obtain  additional  data  on visual  impairment  and  blindness  and  their  prevention 
with  special  emphasis  on the  situation  in developing  countries,  keeping  in mind  the  need  for  a 
generally  accepted  definition  of blindness  and  visual  impairment  ； 
(2) to  promote  further  studies  on the most  efficient  and  economical  means  of preventing  blindness, 
such  studies  to be carried  out  on an interdisciplinary  basis  in collaboration  with  other  organizations 
active  in this  field; 
(3) to  assist  Member  States  in educational  programmes  related  to blindness  and  visual  impairment, 
including  those  for the development  of ophthalmological  departments  in medical  schools  ； 
(4) to  intensify  technical  assistance  to national  programmes  for the prevention  of visual  impairment 
and blindness,  particularly  in programmes  against  trachoma,  onchocerciasis  and  xerophthalmia.
