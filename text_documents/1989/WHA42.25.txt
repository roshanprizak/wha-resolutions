INTERNATIONAL  DRINKING  WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION  DECADE 
The Forty-second  World Health Assembly, 
Noting that, despite  the significant  progress  to date in expanding  service  coverage 
during the International  Drinking  Water Supply and Sanitation  Decade both in absolute  and 
relative  terms, there still remain mostly in rural areas, over 1100 million  inhabitants 
of the developing  countries  without  access to an adequate  and safe water supply,  and 
approximately  1800 million  without  appropriate  facilities  for excreta  disposal; 
Recognizing  that, in view of rapid population  growth,  particularly  the continued 
urban expansion,  service  coverage  will begin to decline  if programme  implementation  is 
not accelerated; 
Emphasizing  the key role of adequate  and safe water supply and appropriate 
sanitation  in the prevention  of disease  and promotion  of health; 
1. WELCOMES  the advocacy  and leadership  role taken by WHO during the Decade,  and calls 
for a sustained  effort during the 1990s to enable activities  initiated  during the Decade 
to be extended  and intensified; 
2. URGES  those Member States which are not likely to meet the targets  of the 
International  Drinking  Water Supply and Sanitation  Decade : 
(1) to review the status of their water supply and sanitation  services  and 
accordingly  develop  strategies  and plans to accelerate  the implementation  of 
national  programmes  as integral  components  of national  health policies； 
(2) to expand development  of this sector during the 1990s with emphasis  on the 
rural underserved  and the urban poor; 
(3) to adopt innovative  approaches  to the promotion  and financing  of water supply 
and sanitation  systems,  including  economic  incentives,  cost-sharing  procedures  and 
devices such as revolving  funds geared towards  the achievement  of maximum  coverage 
of needs； 
3. URGES external  support  agencies  : 
(1) to increase  funding  for this sector,  with special  attention  to the least 
developed  countries； 
(2) to improve  information  exchange,  coordination  and cooperation,  particularly  at 
country level, in order to increase  the effectiveness  of their support  to national 
programmes； I

4. INVITES  the regional  committees  to review regional  policies  and strategies  for the 
provision  of safe water supply and adequate  sanitation  and accordingly  reaffirm  the 
priority  accorded  to these programmes  as essential  to the maintenance  of community 
health; 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to ensure the continuation  of WHO's advocacy  and leadership  role in this 
sector, consistent  with primary  health care principles  and with emphasis  on the 
development  of national  institutions,  human resources,  information  exchange, 
appropriate  technology,  water quality,  community  participation,  including  an 
enhanced  role for women, health education,  operation  and maintenance  and on the 
mobilization  of internal  and external  resources； 
(2) to promote  the development  and implementation  of innovative  approaches  to the 
provision  and financing  of water supply and sanitation  systems; 
(3) to play an active role in coordination  and collaboration  within the global 
collaborative  framework  established  in 1988 with the consensus  of external  support 
agencies  to assist the governments  of developing  countries  in achieving  the widest 
possible  provision  of water supply and sanitation  services  in the years ahead; 
(4) to submit to the Forty-fifth  World Health Assembly  in 1992 a report on the 
situation  at the end of the Decade,  as requested  by the Thirty-ninth  World Health 
Assembly  in its resolution  WHA39.20,  including  critical  evaluation  on the progress 
and results  of the Decade,  and on that basis WHO's updated  strategy  for water supply 
and sanitation  within the framework  of the health-for-all  strategy; 
(5) to explore  with partners  in the United Nations  system the desirability  of 
extending  the formal framework  of the Decade until the year 2000.
