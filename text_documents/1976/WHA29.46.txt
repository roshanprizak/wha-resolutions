WHA29.46  Health  aspects  of human  settlements 
The Twenty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  WHO'S  human  health  and  environment  programme  and  the  mid-decade  progress 
report  of the Director-General  on community  water  supply  and  wastewater  disposal  on which  it has adopted 
resolutions; 
Noting  the  statement  presented  to the  Health  Assembly  by the  Secretary-General  of Habitat:  United 
Nations  Conference  on Human  Settlements,  which  will  take  place  in Vancouver  from  31 May  to 11 June  1976; 
Having  also  considered  the  report  on the  Technical  Discussions  on the  health  aspects  of human 
settlements  ； 
Considering  that  the World  Health  Organization,  by virtue  of its Constitution,  is the specialized  agency 
concerned  with  the safeguarding  and  promotion  of health  and  environmental  conditions  in human  settlements; 
Aware  of the unprecedented  growth  rate  of population,  of the  surge  of rural  populations  into  urban 
areas,  and  continued  lack  of tangible  improvements  in rural  areas,  particularly  in developing  countries, 
which  is exacerbating  the  health  and  environmental  problems  of human  settlements; 
1. EMPHASIZES  the  vital  need  to take  into  consideration  health  and  environmental  aspects  in the planning 
and development  of human  settlements,  using  a comprehensive  and  multidisciplinary  approach  ； 
2. RECOMMENDS  that  governments: 
(1) ensure  that  health  authorities  at central  and  local  levels  have  scientific  and  technical  competence 
and sufficient  breadth  of responsibility  in relation  to environmental  health  and  preventive  medicine  to 
influence  the  hygienic  features  of human  settlements  which  are  fundamentally  important  to health, 
including  water  supply,  hygienic  wastes  disposal,  adequate  nutrition  and  decent  shelter; 
(2) promote  full  cooperation  between  health  and  other  central  and  local  government  departments  as 
well as the voluntary  agencies  and  the  community  in order  that  health  considerations  should  be taken 
into account  ab initio  in the planning  and  development  of human  settlements;  an important  aspect  of this 
is the education  of decision-makers  in the  planning,  architectural,  economic  and  social  fields  as to the 
importance  of the potential  health  contributions  to life  in human  settlements; 
(3) undertake  the  study  of health  aspirations  and  needs  of populations  in human  settlements  and 
those  conditions  of the environment  predisposing  to ill health;  determine  the respective  priorities  of these 
needs;  and,  as far as is practicable,  allocate  resources  for their  resolution  and  for the continuing  monitoring of the  situation; 
(4) undertake  the  evaluation  of the  administrative,  organizational  and  legislative  structure  of their 
health  services  in terms  of fulfilling  the health  responsibilities  within  the  framework  of national  policies 
for human  settlements  and  revising  them  where  appropriate,  bearing  in mind  the importance  of flexibility 
in such  matters; 
3. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  : 
(1) to  give  an appropriately  high  priority  to collaboration  with  Member  States  on programmes  aimed 
at studying  and  solving  population  growth,  health  and  environmental  problems  in human  settlements 
in a comprehensive  manner; 
(2) to  study  carefully  the implications  of the recommendations  which  will  ensue  from  Habitat:  United 
Nations  Conference  on Human  Settlements  and,  thereafter,  to study  ways  and  means  of providing 
increased  technical  collaboration  to Member  countries; 
(3) to  promote,  strengthen  and  coordinate  research  on the effects  on health  of the physical  and  social 
environment  of human  settlements,  and  to endeavour  to develop  suitable  scientific  methodology  applicable  to resolving  health  problems  of human  settlements  under  varying  geographical  and  climatic 
conditions; 
(4) to  prepare  appropriate  environmental  health  criteria  pertaining  to housing,  the residential  environment,  and  human  settlements  ； 
(5) to  build  up an information  system,  based  on information  from  Member  States,  on all health  aspects 
of human  settlements  ； 
(6) to  further  strengthen  WHO'S  collaboration  with  the  United  Nations  and  the  United  Nations 
agencies  and  programmes; 
(7) to  evaluate  the  work  of the Organization  in the field  of health  aspects  of human  settlements  and 
report  to a subsequent  World  Health  Assembly  on the  progress  which  has  been  made  and  on his conclusions  and  recommendations  for  future  work; 
(8) to  draw  the  attention  of Habitat  : United  Nations  Conference  on Human  Settlements  to this 
resolution.
