WHA22.35  Socio-economic  Consequences  of the Zoonoses 
The Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that  some  zoonoses  are recognized  as major  health  problems  in most  countries  of the world, 
affecting  the health  and  well-being  of millions  of human  beings,  preventing  the efficient  production  of food 
and impeding  economic  development; 
Considering  that  the zoonoses  affect  all countries  of the world  and  result  in a great  waste  of resources, 
both  human  and  animal,  much  of which  could  be prevented  by modern  technology; 
Considering  that  the socio-economic  consequences  of continued  losses  due  to the zoonoses  may  prevent 
normal  growth  of animal  populations,  their  development  and  improvement  of productivity;  and 
Considering  that  all countries  are concerned  with  the control  and  prevention  of the zoonoses,  and  that 
the countries  themselves  have  to determine  the magnitude  and  socio-economic  consequences  of the problem, 
1. RECOGNIZES  the importance  for each  Member  State  of surveying  and  evaluating  the importance  of the 
zoonoses  and  the relative  priority  which  that  group  of diseases  should  receive  in national  planning  for socioeconomic  development; 
2. CONSIDERS  it desirable  that  the World  Health  Organization  and  the Food  and  Agriculture  Organization 
should  collaborate  in preparing  methodology  and  criteria  to be used  by Member  States  in carrying  out  the 
necessary  surveillance  and  evaluation  of control  programmes;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to consult  with  the Director-General  of the Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  concerning  this  proposed  joint  endeavour,  and  to report  his findings  and  recommendations  on the 
matter  to the forty-fifth  session  of the Executive  Board.
