The Second  World  Health  Assembly 
CONSIDERS  that  any  withholding  of scientific  or technical  information  on essential 
therapeutic  and  prophylactic  drugs,  in selling  or otherwise  supplying  nations  with  the 
means  for their  production,  or withholding  the  free  exchange  of medical  scientists, 
is not  compatible  with  the  ideals  of the  World  Health  Organization  and  is against  the 
interests  of humanity.
