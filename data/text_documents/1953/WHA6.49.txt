WHA6.49  Relations  with  Non-Governmental  Organizations 
The Sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  studied  the question  of relations  with  non-governmental  organizations  ; 
Taking  into  account  the report  of the Director-General  and  the comments  of the Executive  Board  on 
this subject,3' 
1. is OF  THE  OPINION  that  there  is no reason  to modify  the general  principles  governing  the  admission 
of non-governmental  organizations  into  relations  with  WHO,  as approved  by the Third  World  Health 
Assembly  ; and 
2. RECOGNIZES  that  according  to these  principles  there  can  be no objection  to the plurality  of representation of non-governmental  organizations  in the same  fields  of activity,  and  that,  consequently,  the Executive 
Board  should  take  this  fact  into  consideration  whenever  the  non-governmental  organizations  concerned 
satisfy  the conditions  laid  down  and  their  admission  is justified  by their  importance. 
(Fourth  report  of the  Committee  on  Administration, 
Finance  and  Legal  Matters,  adopted  at the  tenth
