 RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 3 
 
 
 
 
WHA57.2 Control of human African trypanosomiasis 
The Fifty-seventh World Health Assembly, 
Recalling resolutions WHA50.36 and WHA56.7; 
Having considered the report on human African trypanosomiasis;1 
Deeply concerned by the resurgence of African trypanosomiasis and its devastating effect on 
human and livestock populations on the African continent; 
Recognizing that the human form of this disease constitutes a major public health problem 
because of its invariably fatal outcome in untreated  cases, the frequency of permanent neurological 
impairments in treated cases including, especially, permanent mental and psychomotor impairments in 
children, and its propensity to occur in epidemics; 
Further concerned by the growing problems of drug resistance and treatment failure; 
Welcoming the high level of political commitment to combat human African trypanosomiasis 
expressed by government leaders of countries in which the disease is endemic; 
Further welcoming the renewed commitment to control this disease expressed in recent 
initiatives and public-private partnerships, which have greatly relieved the problem of inadequate 
access to existing drugs; 
Noting that, although great strides are being made in controlling this disease, better control 
tools, including safer and more effective drugs and simplified diagnostic tests, are badly needed, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to continue to give high priority to the control of human African trypanosomiasis; (2) in endemic areas, to increase human resources and dedicated financing, drawing as 
appropriate on funds previously used for the purchase of drugs; and to strengthen case detection, 
diagnosis and treatment, and the infrastructure for doing so; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to continue to refine control strategies  so as to make maximum use of national and 
international resources and to prevent further epidemic spread; 
(2) to promote among the various sectors and agencies concerned an integrated approach that 
takes into account the importance of vector co ntrol and of control of disease in livestock; 
(3) to continue to collaborate closely with all partners concerned, notably through the 
UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical 
Diseases on research to develop safer and more effective drugs and simplified tests for trypanosomal detection;
