Agenda item 11.18 21 May 2010 
Improvement of health through sound management 
of obsolete pesticides and other obsolete chemicals 
 
The Sixty-third World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on the Strate gic Approach to International Chemicals 
Management;1 
Recalling resolution WHA59.15 on the Strategi c Approach to International Chemicals 
Management; 
Recognizing the outcomes of the second session of the International Conference on Chemicals 
Management (Geneva, 11–15 May 2009) regarding huma n health and, in particular, resolution II/8 on 
health aspects of the sound management of chemical s which drew attention to the need for a greater 
involvement of health sector, Member States2 and the WHO Secretariat in the implementation of the 
Global Plan of Action of the Strategic Appr oach to International Chemicals Management3 because of 
the adverse effects some chemicals may have on human health, and noting that some of the global 
priorities for cooperative action identified within th e Strategic Approach to International Chemicals 
Management also have to be dealt with by the health sector; 
Recognizing that pesticides are designed to kill or control harmful organisms and pests, and 
may have adverse acute and chronic effects, and that, although they are regulated in most countries, 
they may affect populations’ health and the enviro nment, particularly when improperly used and 
stored, including when they are obsolete;4 
Recalling WHO’s Constitution, and recognizing the following relevant international agreements 
and instruments: the Bali Declaration on Wast e Management for Human Health and Livelihood 
(2008), the United Nations Conference on Environm ent and Development (Rio  de Janeiro, Brazil,

3 Document WHA59/2006/REC/1, Annex 1. 
4 The International HCH and Pesticides Association (IHPA) estimates that total amount of obsolete pe sticides is 
about 260 000–265 000 tonnes in central and eastern Europe and the countries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics. Estimated amounts in 25 Member States of the Eu ropean Union are 22 000–24 000 tonnes, south-east Europe 
36 000–41 000 tonnes, the countries of the former Union of S oviet Socialist Republics 199 000 tonnes, Africa 50 000 tonnes 
(estimated by FAO in its Africa Stockpiles Programme), South-East Asia 6500 tonnes (FAO, first rough indication), 
Central and South America 30 000 tonnes (FAO, 2005). WHA63.26 
 
 
  
 
 
2 1992), the World Summit on Sustainable Developm ent (Johannesburg, South Africa, 2002), the 
adoption of the Strategic Approach to Internatio nal Chemicals Management by the International 
Conference on Chemicals Management (Dubai, 2006) , the Basel Convention on the Control of the 
Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes  and Their Disposal (1989), the Rotterdam 
Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedur e for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides 
in International Trade (2004, revised 2008), th e Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic 
Pollutants (Stockholm, 2004), and the Convention on  the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping 
of Wastes and Other Matter 1972 and 1996 Protocol Thereto (Londo n 1972), and the International 
Health Regulations (2005); 
Recognizing that all the forums,  conventions and instruments mentioned in the preceding 
paragraph are important global tools for the prese rvation and protection of human health and the 
environment that provide measures and guidelines to d eal with certain aspects of chemicals’ life-cycle, 
and that, in that sense, the closely linked Stockhol m Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and 
Basel Convention on the Control of the Transbound ary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their 
Disposal1 foresee the development of appropriate strate gies for identification of persistent organic 
pollutant wastes, stockpiles of persistent  organic pollutants and their management; 
Recognizing that hazardous waste and highly toxic pesticides fall under the global priority areas 
identified for cooperative action within the Stra tegic Approach to International Chemicals 
Management, and that the Health Assembly in  resolution WHA59.15 on Strategic Approach to 
International Chemicals Management  urged Member States to participate in national, regional and 
international efforts to implement the Strategic Approach; 
Mindful of the new challenges and determinants of  health and of the need for additional action 
in order to preserve and protect human health and the environment; 
Recognizing the risks to human health and environment from obsolete pesticides and other 
obsolete chemicals, particularly through local  and global chemical accidents and disasters; 
Recognizing also the risks to human health and environment from obsolete pesticides and other 
obsolete chemicals, linked to the creation of stockpiles resulting from th eir regulation (such as 
withdrawal from the market without appropriate ph ase-out period) or inherited from past periods of 
pesticides over-consumption, which might further l ead to spreading of improperly stored chemicals 
worldwide; 
Recalling the fact that the exposure of humans a nd the environment to obsolete pesticides and 
other obsolete chemicals may also be due to their long-range transport; 
Recognizing the threat of unsafe storage of obsol ete pesticides and other obsolete chemicals, 
which, owing to illegal use, package deteriorati on, or accidents may cause localized or widespread 
pollution and represent a potential risk to human health and the environment; 
Mindful of the clear evidence that, besides envi ronmental benefits, health benefits can be 
expected from safe and efficient handling and di sposal of obsolete pesticides and other obsolete 
chemicals; 
                                                      
1 The fundamental aims of the Basel Convention are th e control and reduction of transboundary movement of 
hazardous and other wastes subject to the Convention, th e prevention and minimization of their generation, the 
environmentally sound management of such wastes and active promotion of the tran sfer and use of cleaner technologies.   WHA63.26 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  Acknowledging the progress regarding obsolete p esticides made by African countries through 
the interagency Africa Stockpiles Programme with  the support of FAO, the Global Environment 
Facility, the World Bank and other partners; 
Welcoming the work of the Basel Convention on  the Control of the Transboundary Movements 
of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal in de veloping technical guidelines on the environmentally 
sound disposal of wastes containing  persistent organic pollutants;
