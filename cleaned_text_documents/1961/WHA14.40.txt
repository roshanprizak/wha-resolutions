The Fourteenth World Health Assembly, Having examined the Director-General's report on the smallpox eradication programme; Considering that progress has been made in the programme, particularly as concerns the production of potent and stable vaccines; and Noting, however, that this disease still represents an important problem in international travel, according to the reports of the WHO Committee on International Quarantine, that for this reason it is urgent to speed up the activities of the programme, and that in order to do so it is necessary to provide adequate material resources and advisory services, 1. RECOMMENDS that those countries which have not yet done so should start their eradication programme as soon as possible; 2. URGES those countries more economically advanced to make voluntary contributions in cash or in kind so as to increase the funds of the WHO Special Account; and 3. REQUESTS the Director-General to report further to the Fifteenth World Health Assembly. Handb. Res., 5th ed., 1.5.4 Eleventh plenary meeting, 22 February 1961 (section 5 of the fourth report of the Committee on Programme and Budget)
