WHA4.83  Criteria  for determining  the Limits  of Yellow-Fever  Endemic  Zones 
Considering  that  the definition  of yellow-fever  endemic  zones,  contained  in the International  Sanitary Regulations  (WHO  Regulations  No.  2) is based  on the  presence  of AÃ«des  aegypti  and  the  persistence of the virus  among  jungle  animals  over  long  periods  of time  ; 
Considering  also  that,  owing  to vaccination  campaigns  and  other  causes,  immunity  in man  to yellow 
fever,  as detected  by the mouse  protection-test,  is to be found  beyond  the limits  of yellow-fever  endemic 
zones  as so defined, 
The Fourth  World  Health  Assembly 
INVITES  the Executive  Board  and  the  Director-General  to make  the necessary  arrangements  for the study  and  definition  of technical  criteria  required  for  the  delineation  of yellow-fever  endemic  zones  as defined  in WHO  Regulations  No.  2. (Presented  by the Committee  on International  Sanitary Regulations  and  adopted  at the  eleventh  plenary meeting,  25  May  1951)  [A4/R/69]
