The Twenty-eighth World Health Assembly, Recalling resolutions WHA5.28 and WHA27.58; and Noting that leprosy control measures can reduce substantially the prevalence of leprosy when undertaken with sustained effort fora sufficiently long period, 1. RECOMMENDS that: (1) intensive case-detection be carried out to ensure early diagnosis, particularly in children; (2) infectious cases be identified, and when possible be submitted initially to closely supervised treatment to minimize infectiousness and thus the spread of disease; 2. EMPHASIZES the need for health services to integrate leprosy control as A regular continuing activity; and 3. REQUESTS the Director-General to lay greater stress on the training of multidisciplinary staff to improve levels of competence in leprosy control. Handb. Res., Vol. II1.8.5.2 Twelfth plenary meeting, 28 May 1975 (Committee A, second report)
