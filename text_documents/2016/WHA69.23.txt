Follow -up of the report of the Consultative Expert 
Working Group on Research and Development: 
Financing and Coordination  
 
The Sixty-ninth  World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on follow -up to the report of the Consultative Expert Working 
Group on Research and Development: Financing and Coordination â€’ report of the open -ended meeting 
of Member State s;1 
Recalling WHA66.22 (2013) and subsequent Health Assembly decisions on the follow -up of the 
report of the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development: Financing and 
Coordination, and noting progress made in the implementation of the st rategic workplan endorsed in 
resolution WHA66.22;  
Acknowledging that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes the commitment to 
support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and 
noncommunicable diseases th at primarily affect developing countries, provide access to affordable 
medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public 
Health, which affirms the right of developing countries to use to the full the provisio ns in the 
Agreement on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights regarding flexibilities to protect 
public health, and, in particular, provide access to medicines for all;  
Recalling the global strategy and plan of action on public health, innov ation and intellectual 
property and its aims to promote innovation, build capacity, improve access and mobilize resources to 
address diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries;  
Noting with particular concern that for millions of people th e right to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including access to medicines, remains a 
distant goal, that especially for children and those living in poverty, the likelihood of achieving this 
goal is becoming in creasingly remote;  
Noting the establishment of the High -Level Panel on Access to Medicines convened by the 
United Nations Secretary -General;  
Underscoring that health research and development should be needs -driven and evidence -based 
and be guided by the fo llowing core principles: affordability, effectiveness, efficiency, and equity; and 
that it should be considered a shared responsibility;

2 Acknowledging the central role of the Global Observatory on Health Research and 
Development to consolidate, monitor and  analyze relevant information on health research and 
development activities related to Type II and Type III diseases and on the specific research and 
development needs of developing countries in relation to Type I diseases, as well as needs for 
information  on potential areas where market failures exist, and also on antimicrobial resistance and 
emerging infectious diseases likely to cause major epidemics, building on national and regional 
observatories (or equivalent functions) and existing data collection m echanisms, with a view to 
contributing to the identification and the definition of gaps and opportunities for health research and 
development priorities, and supporting coordinated actions on health research and development;  
Expressing concern at the signi ficant gap in funding the strategic workplan endorsed in 
resolution WHA66.22, including the six selected demonstration projects,  
1. URGES Member States:1 
(1) to make concerted efforts, including through adequate and sustainable funding, to fully 
implement the strategic workplan endorsed in resolution WHA66.22;  
(2) to create, operationalize and strengthen, as appropriate, national health research and 
development observatories, or equivalent functions for tracking and monitoring of relevant 
information on hea lth research and development, and to provide regular information on relevant 
health research and development activities to the Global Observatory on Health Research and 
Development or to other existing data collection mechanisms that provide regular report s to the 
Global Observatory on Health Research and Development;  
(3) to provide support to the Director -General for the development of sustainable financing 
mechanisms for the full implementation of the strategic workplan endorsed in resolution 
WHA66.22 ; 
2. REQUESTS the Director -General:  
(1) to expedite the full implementation of the strategic workplan endorsed in resolution 
WHA66.22;  
(2) to expedite the further development of a fully functional Global Observatory on Health 
Research and Development;  
(3) to submit terms of reference and a costed workplan of the Global Observatory on Health 
Research and Development to the Seventieth World Health Assembly, through the Executive 
Board at its 140th session, under the agenda item on the Consultative Expert Working Group on 
Research and Development: Financing and Coordination;  
(4) to expedite, as part of the development of the Global Observatory on Health Research and 
Development, the development of norms and standards for classification of health research and 
devel opment, including common reporting formats, building on existing sources, in consultation 
with Member State experts and relevant stakeholders in order to collect and collate information 
systematically;

development with the Global Observatory on  Health Research and Development;  
(6) to support Member States in their endeavours to establish or strengthen health research 
and development capacities, including the monitoring of relevant information on health research 
and development;  
(7) to establish a WHO Expert Committee on Health Research and Development to provide
