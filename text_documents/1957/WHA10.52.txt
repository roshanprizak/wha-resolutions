VVHA10.52  Implementation  of Resolution  WHA7.33 
The Tenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  with  regret  that  the problem  of the normal  functioning  of the Eastern  Mediterranean  Regional 
Organization  has  not  yet found  a satisfactory  solution,  and  that  resolution  WHA7.33  has  not,  up to the 
present  time,  served  the purpose  for which  it was  adopted, 
EXPRESSES  the hope  that  efforts  will  be made  by all concerned  to aid in the search  for a satisfactory 
solution. 
Twelfth  plenary  meeting,  24 May  1957  (section  5 of
