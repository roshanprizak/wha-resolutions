WHO  response  to global  change: 
Health  Assembly  resolutions 
The Forty-seventh  World Health Assembly, 
Having considered  the report of the Director-General,1  as well as the report and recommendations 
of the Executive  Board Working  Group on the WHO Response  to Global Change,2  concerning  mechanisms 
and procedures  for the development,  review and follow-up  of resolutions  of the Health Assembly; 
Bearing in mind Article XIII of the Financial  Regulations  of WHO and Rule 13 of the Rules of 
Procedure  of the Health Assembly,  as well as resolutions  WHA31.9  and WHA44.30  on the method of work 
of the Health Assembly; 
Considering  the desirability  of more systematic  prior review of all resolutions  proposed  to the Health 
Assembly  that have potential  impact on the objectives,  policy and orientation  of WHO or that h^ve 
implications  in terms of staffing,  costs, budgetary  resources  and administrative  support, 
1. REITERATES  the general principle  that, in order to ensure the Health Assembly  has sufficient 
information  before considering  proposals,  resolutions  should be considered  by the Executive  Board before 
being considered  by the Health Assembly; 
2. AUTHORIZES  the Executive  Board, in coordination  with the Director-General,  to establish  a routine 
procedure  for prior review of resolutions  designed  to ensure that sufficient  information  is available  to the 
Health Assembly  in line with recommendation  5 of the Working  Group on Global Change; 
3. REQUESTS: 
(1) the Director-General  to ensure that the necessary  background  information,  including 
information  about the implications  of adopting  resolutions  proposed,  is provided  as a matter of 
routine to the Executive  Board and subsequently  transmitted  in an appropriate  manner to the Health 
Assembly; 
(2) the Chairman  of the Executive  Board, supported  by the Director-General,  to help to ensure 
that, when appropriate,  draft resolutions  that are first introduced  in the Board clearfy set out a 
realistic time-limit  for validity of the resolution  and an appropriate  mechanism  and interval  for 
following  up and reporting  on implementation;

2 Document  EB92/1993/REC/1,  Annex  1, p. 14，item  4.2.1.1. 
WHA47.5745 
4. RECOGNIZES  nonetheless  that the Health Assembly  may decide to consider  a resolution  not 
transmitted  to it by the Executive  Board; in such a case, the Director-General  shall provide a statement 
of its programme  and budget implications  before the adoption  of the resolution  in Committee; 
5. REQUESTS,  when a resolution  is first initiated  and presented  at the Health Assembly  without prior 
review by the Executive  Board, that: 
(1) the Chairmen  of Committees  A and В of the Health Assembly  will consult their respective 
officers, supported  by the Director-General,  and depending  on whether  the Committee  concerned  has 
sufficient  information,  refer the matter to the General  Committee  or request  the Committee 
concerned  to consider  the resolution  directly; 
(2) the General  Committee  in such cases, and in consultation  with the Director-General,  make a 
recommendation  as to whether  the draft resolution  should be considered  by the Health Assembly  and 
what further information  (if any) would be needed or whether  any other appropriate  course of action 
should be taken; 
(3) the Chairmen  of Committees  A and В endeavour  to ensure that, when appropriate,  draft 
resolutions  that are introduced  in their committees  clearly set a realistic  time-limit  for validity of the 
resolution  and establish  an appropriate  mechanism  and interval  for following  up and reporting  on 
implementation; 
6. RECOMMENDS  that these mechanisms  and approaches  be tested over a period of two years by the 
Executive  Board and the Health Assembly,  with effect from January  1995; 
7. FURTHER  REQUESTS  the Director-General  to review the results and to report to the Fiftieth 
World Health Assembly  through  the Executive  Board in 1997.
