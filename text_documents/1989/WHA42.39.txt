ORAL HEALTH 
The Forty-second  World health  Assembly, 
Aware that the promotion  of oral health  is an integral  part of health  for all by the 
year 2000, and that the use of fluorides  has been highly  successful  in reducing  caries 
and oral diseases  in many countries； 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA22.30,  WHA28.64,  WHA31.50  and WHA36.14  in this regard; 
Realizing,  however,  that in some countries,  particularly  the developing  ones, oral 
health status  is deteriorating  where preventive  strategies  are not being applied  or 
maintained; 
1. REAFFIRMS  the need for countries,  that have not already  done so, to establish 
national  strategies  for oral health  promotion,  the prevention  of oral diseases  and 
appropriate  care, making  full use of the extensive  technology  now available,  including 
management  techniques； 
2. URGES  Member  States  to make full and appropriate  use of international  collaborative 
oral health  development  programmes,  strengthened  by the partnership  of WHO with the 
International  Dental  Federation  (FDI),  the WHO collaborating  centres,  the intercountry 
centres  for oral health,  and the work of FDI and other nongovernmental  organizations； 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to continue  to support  collaboration  between  WHO and the above-mentioned 
centres  and organizations,  and to mobilize  resources  for action  and research  for the 
promotion  of oral health  as part of primary  health  care； 
(2) to strengthen  WHO's programme  for the provision  of standard  methods  and 
approaches  for prevention  and care, and for training;
