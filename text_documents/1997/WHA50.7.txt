Agenda  item  22.2  12  May  1997 
Status  of collection  of assessed 
contributions 
The Fiftieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  with  concern  that,  as at 31 December  1996: 
(a) the  rate of collection  in 1996  of contributions  to the effective  working  budget  for that year  amounted 
to 77.72%,  leaving  US$  93 394 425 unpaid; 
(b) only  102 Members  had paid  their  contributions  to the effective  working  budget  for that year  in full, 
and 63 Members  had made  no payment; 
(c) total  unpaid  contributions  in respect  of 1996  and prior  years  exceeded  US$  169  million, 
1. EXPRESSES  deep  concern  at the continuing  high  level  of contributions  outstanding,  which  has had a 
deleterious  effect  on programmes  and on the financial  situation; 
2. CALLS  THE  ATTENTION  of all Members  to Financial  Regulation  5.6，which  provides  that  instalments 
of contributions  shall  be considered  as due and payable  in full by the first  day of the year  to which  they  relate, 
and to the importance  of paying  contributions  as early  as possible  to enable  the Director-General  to implement 
the programme  budget  in an orderly  manner; 
3. REMINDS  Members  that,  as a result  of the adoption,  by resolution  WHA41.12,  of an incentive  scheme 
to promote  the timely  payment  of assessed  contributions,  those  that pay their  assessed  contributions  early  in the 
year in which  they  are due will  have  their  contributions  payable  for a subsequent  programme  budget  reduced 
appreciably,  whereas  Members  paying  later  will have  their  contributions  payable  for that subsequent  programme 
budget  reduced  only  marginally  or not at all; 
4. URGES  Members  that are systematically  late in the payment  of their  contributions  to take  immediate  steps 
to ensure  prompt  and regular  payment; 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General,  taking  into  account  developments  in other  organizations  of the United 
Nations  system  and in the review  of the WHO  Constitution,  to continue  to review  all additional  measures  that 
may be appropriate  to the circumstances  of WHO  with  a view  to ensuring  a sound  financial  basis  for 
programmes  and to report  on this matter  to the 101st  session  of the Executive  Board  and the Fifty-first  World 
Health  Assembly; 
6. FURTHER  REQUESTS  the Director-General  to draw  this resolution  to the attention  of all Members.
