The Fourth World Health Assembly, Considering that among the preparations used in agriculture and in the medical field as insecticides, parasiticides and molluscicides, or for similar purposes, there are some which are highly toxic for human beings and animals ; Considering further that this fact may involve, in the case of certain products, a danger for workers exposed to them ; Recognizing that adequate preventive measures and early treatment seem to allow the safe use of these preparations ; Recognizing that regulations on the use of these preparations are extremely different in many countries and are more or less missing in others, REQUESTS the Executive Board and the Director-General, in co-operation with ILO and FAO, to collect information on the extent of the problem and the measures tobe taken to promote safe use of the prepara-tions mentioned. (Fourth report of the Committee on Programme, adopted at the eleventh plenary meeting, 25 May 1951 ) [A4 / R / 74]
