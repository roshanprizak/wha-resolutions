The Fifty-second World Health Assembly,Reaffirming WHOs commitment to the global eradication of poliomyelitis by the end of the year 2000;Recog nizing that substantial progress has been made towards eradication of poliomyelitis, with larg egeogr aphic areas of the world now free of the disease, anda fall of 85% in annually reported cases since globaleradication began in 1988;Noting that, as of May 1999, poliomyelitis remains endemic in a number of countries of southern an dwestern Asia and the African continent, some of which are either affected by conflict or constitute densel ypopulated wild poliovirus reservoirs;Realizing that civil strife and funding shortfalls represent the two major obstacles to achieving poliomyelitiseradication;Affirming that poliomyelitis eradication will have humanitarian and economic benefits for all countries,1. URGES poliomyelitis-endemic Member States to accelerate eradication activities by conducting additionalimmunization rounds each year, on either a national or subnational basis; to improve the quality of nationa limmuniz ation days by ensuring that every child is reached; to implement house-to-house mopping-up campaig ns; and to enhance surveillance by ensuring that all cases of acute flaccid paralysis are detected an dpromptly investigated;2. URGES poliomyelitis-free Member States:(1) to sustain high levels of immunization coverage until eradication is certified globally;(2) to maintain high quality surveillance for importation of wild poliovirus and establish action plansfor rapidly responding to such events;3. URGES all Member States:WHA52.222(1) to mobilize the human and financial resources necessary to accelerate eradication in poliomyelitisendemic countries;(2) to support the peace-building process by facilitating ceasefires for national immunization days incountries affected by conflict;(3) to support the work of the poliomyelitis eradication initiative in strengthening health systems andservices;(4) to begin, in collaboration with WHO, the process leading to the laboratory containment of wil dpoliovirus in maximum containment laboratories;4. REQUESTS the Director-General:(1) to urge all partners to facilitate acceleration of the initiative to eradicate poliomyelitis during th ecritical period 1999 to 2001;(2) to facilit ate, when necessary, coordinated mass immunization activities in bordering areas o fMember States and WHO regions;(3) to collaborate with other or ganizations of the United Nations system and other international bodiesin arrangi ng ceasefires for poliomyelitis eradication and facilitating eradication activities in countrie saffected by conflict;(4) to help mobilize the necessary financing to implement eradication activities, including establishmentof an emergency fund to meet the needs of coun tries affected by conflict, countries classified as major wildpolio virus reservoirs, and other countries in particularly difficult circumstances, and to draw upon th estrengths of the regional offices in the use of these resources;(5) to collaborate with Member States in the establishment of a mechanism for overseeing the processof laboratory containment of wild poliovirus in maximum containment laboratories;(6) to facilitate ongoing research to define the optimum strategy for eventually stopping immunizationagainst poliomyelitis.Tenth plenary meeting, 25 May 1999A52 / VR / 10= = =
