Agenda item 15.1 26 May 20 15 
Global action plan on antimicrobial resistance  
 
The Sixty -eighth World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the summary report on progress made in implementing resolution 
WHA67.25 on antimicrobial resistance and the report on the draft global action plan on antimicrobial 
resistance;1 
Recalling resolutions WHA39.27 and WHA47.13 on the rational use of drugs, 
resolutio n WHA51.17 on emerging and other communicable diseases: antimicrobial resistance, 
resolution WHA54.14 on global health security: epidemic alert and response, resolution WHA58.27 
on improving the containment of antimicrobial resistance, resolution WHA60.16 on progress in the 
rational use of medicines and resolution WHA66.22 on follow up of the report of the Consultative 
Expert Working Group on Research and Development: Financing and Coordination and WHA67.25 
on antimicrobial resistance;  
Aware that access to effective antimicrobial agents constitutes a prerequisite for most modern 
medicine; that hard -won gains in health and development, in particular those brought about through 
the health -related Millennium Development Goals, are put at risk by increasing resi stance to 
antimicrobials; and that antimicrobial resistance threatens the sustainability of the public health 
response to many communicable diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS;  
Aware that the health and economic consequences of antimicro bial resistance constitute a heavy 
and growing burden on high -, middle - and low -income countries, requiring urgent action at national, 
regional and global levels, particularly in view of the limited development of new antimicrobial 
agents;  
Recognizing that  the main impact of antimicrobial resistance is on human health, but that both 
the contributing factors and the consequences, including economic and others, go beyond health, and 
that there is a need for a coherent, comprehensive and integrated approach at  global, regional and 
national levels, in a “One Health ” approach and beyond, involving different actors and sectors such as 
human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, finance, environment and consumers;  
Aware that the inappropriate use of antimicrobial m edicines in all relevant sectors continues to 
be an urgent and widespread problem in high -, middle - and low -income countries, with serious 
consequences for increasing antimicrobial resistance in a wide range of pathogens including bacteria, 
viruses and par asites;

2 Noting that despite sustained efforts over a number of decades by Member States, the 
Secretariat and partners, most developing countries are still facing a multitude of challenges in 
improving affordability and universal access to quality, safe and  effective antimicrobial medicines and 
diagnostic tools;  
Recognizing that, although substantial investments have already been made to tackle 
antimicrobial resistance, significantly more resources need to be mobilized to support effective action 
at national , regional and global levels, including through the provision of technical and financial 
assistance, particularly to low - and middle -income countries;  
Reaffirming the critical importance of enhancing infection prevention and control, including 
good sanitat ion and hygiene, in both community and health care settings;  
Recognizing the importance of immunization as one of the most cost -effective public health 
interventions, and that vaccines play an important role in reducing antimicrobial resistance;  
Underlini ng the pressing need to develop new antimicrobial medicines as well as effective, 
rapid and low -cost diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions, and recalling the Global Strategy 
and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Prop erty and resolution WHA66.22 
on follow -up of the report of the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development: 
Financing and Coordination, which address drug market failure;  
Acknowledging the urgent need for a more coordinated and harmonized  surveillance system to 
monitor antimicrobial resistance at national, regional and global levels, including the need to develop 
internationally agreed standards for data collection and reporting across the human health, medical, 
veterinary and agricultural  sectors;  
Underscoring the need to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance 
through effective public communication programmes, education and training as well as in the human 
health, veterinary and agricultural  sectors,  
1. ADOPTS the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance;  
2. URGES Member States:1 
(1) to implement the proposed actions for Member States in the global action plan on

(2) to mobilize hu man and financial resources through domestic, bilateral and multilateral 
channels in order to implement plans and strategies in line with the global action plan  on 
antimicrobial resistance ;
