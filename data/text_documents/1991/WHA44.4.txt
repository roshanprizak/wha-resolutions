FORTY-FOURTH  WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY  WHA44•4 
Agenda item 17.2 13  May 1991 
RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT  IN THE FIELD OF CHILDREN'S  VACCINES 
The Forty-fourth  World Health Assembly, 
Noting the report of the Director-General  on the WHO/UNDP  programme  for vaccine 
development; 
Appreciating  the accomplishments  of the programme  for vaccine  development  during its 
first six years of existence  in developing  several  candidate  vaccines  against  viral or 
bacterial  diseases  and in promoting  the establishment  of new approaches  for the design of 
single-dose  slow-release  and oral vaccines,  including  tetanus  vaccine； 
Noting that new and improved  vaccines  against  viral and bacterial  diseases  could 
save as many as six to eight million  lives annually  during the 1990s； 
Considering  that the objectives  and targets  of the programme  for vaccine  development 
represent  an essential  component  of the global effort to develop  improved  and new 
essential  vaccines  against  major childhood  diseases,  and thus to improve  means to 
immunize  all children  of the world within the scope of the Children's  Vaccine  Initiative； 
1. ENDORSES  the objectives  and targets  of the programme  for vaccine  development, 
including: 
(1) improved  access to immunization,  concentrating  on developing  improved  vaccines 
against childhood  diseases  that could simplify  immunization  schedules,  that would 
require only one or two doses, that could be given earlier  in life, and that could 
be combined  in novel ways, reducing  unit costs, bringing  down drop-out  rates and 
ensuring  greater  heat-stability  and efficiency; 
(2) support  for the acceleration  of the development  of new vaccines  against 
bacterial  meningitides,  acute respiratory  infections,  diarrhoeal  diseases,  viral 
hepatitis,  dengue,  tuberculosis  and other communicable  diseases; 
2. URGES  Member States: 
(1) to intensify  efforts  made at national  level to accelerate  research  related  to 
vaccine development； 
(2) to collaborate  in international  initiatives  aimed at the development  of new and 
improved  vaccines  and to participate  in the field assessment  of candidate  vaccines； 
3. CALLS  ON bilateral  and multilateral  development  agencies,  nongovernmental 
organizations  and foundations  : 
(1) to increase  their support  for vaccine  research  within the scope of the 
Children's  Vaccine  Initiative； 
WHA44.4 
page 2 
(2) to support  and strengthen  national  coordination  mechanisms  to promote  vaccine 
development; 
(3) to support  the development  of international  partnerships  to strengthen 
countries'  capabilities  for developing,  producing  and assessing  new vaccines  within 
the scope of the Children's  Vaccine  Initiative； 
(4) to support  disease  surveillance  and monitoring  of immunization  coverage； 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to ensure the attainment  of these objectives  and 
targets and WHO'S maximal  support  to the Children's  Vaccine  Initiative  by: 
(1) stimulating  research  on new and improved  viral and bacterial  vaccines； 
(2) coordinating  international  and national  efforts  aimed at the development, 
production  and delivery  of those vaccines； 
(3) intensifying  WHO's collaboration  with industry  in order to accelerate  vaccine 
research  and development  and to ensure that new vaccines  are accessible  and 
affordable  for the populations  affected; 
(4) increasing  efforts  to train scientists  from developing  countries  in all aspects 
of vaccinology,  including  biotechnology,  immunology,  field trials and quality 
control,  and providing  more opportunities  for these scientists  to participate  in 
vaccine research; 
(5) requesting  multilateral  and bilateral  agencies  to place greater  emphasis  on the 
provision  of assistance  for vaccine  research  and vaccine  trials in endemic 
countries； 
(6) mobilizing  additional  resources  for the programme  for vaccine  development  in 
collaboration  with UNDP, the со-sponsoring  agency,  UNICEF and other international 
parties； 
5. FURTHER  REQUESTS  the Director-General  to keep the Executive  Board and the Health 
Assembly  informed  of the progress  made in implementing  this resolution.
