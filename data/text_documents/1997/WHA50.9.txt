The Fiftieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  that  Andorra,  a Member  of the United  Nations,  became  a Member  of the World  Health 
Organization  by depositing  with  the Secretary-General  of the United  Nations  a formal  instrument  of acceptance

Noting  that  the United  Nations  General  Assembly,  in resolution  48/223,  established  the assessment  of 
Andorra  at the rate of 0.01%; 
Recalling  the principle  established  in resolution  WHA8.5,  and confirmed  in resolution  WHA24.12,  that 
the latest  available  United  Nations  scale  of assessments  should  be used  as a basis  for determining  the scale  of 
assessments  to be used  by WHO; 
Recalling  further  that the Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly,  in resolution  WHA26.21,  affirmed  its 
belief  that the scale  of assessments  in WHO  should  follow  as closely  as possible  that  of the United  Nations,
