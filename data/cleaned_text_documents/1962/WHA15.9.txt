The Fifteenth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Director-General on the status of collection of contributions and of advances to the Working Capital Fund as at 30 April 1962; Noting the collection of contributions in respect of the 1962 budget and of advances to the Working Capital Fund; and Noting with satisfaction the payments made by Members to liquidate their arrears of contributions, 1. CALLS THE ATTENTION of Member governments to the importance of providing in their national budgets for regular payment of their annual contributions in the year in which they are due; 2. URGES those Members in arrears to liquidate these arrears in good time, thus making it unnecessary in future for the Assembly to consider, inaccordance with Article 7 of the Constitution, whether or not the right of vote of such a Member should be suspended; 3. DECIDES that the arrangements made by Bolivia for payment of its arrears shall be considered as making it unnecessary to invoke the provisions of paragraph 2 of resolution WHA8.13; and 4. REQUESTS the Director-General to communicate this resolution to the Members concerned. Handb. Res., 6th ed., 7.1.2.4; 7.1.3.3 Eighth plenary meeting, 16 May 1962 (section 1 of the third report of the Committee on Administration, Finance and Legal Matters)
