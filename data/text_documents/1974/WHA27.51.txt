WHA27.51  Development  of the antimalaria  programme 
The Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  the  report  of the  Director-General  that  describes  the  state  of development  of antimalaria 
programmes  ï¼› 
Recognizing  that  malaria  is resurging  in parts  of the world,  has never  been  controlled  in other  parts,  and 
remains  a disease  the control  of which  is of the highest  priority; 
Believing  that  the revised  strategy  adopted  by the Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly  is an effective 
strategy,  but  for a variety  of reasons  has  not  been  effectively  implemented, 
REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  thoroughly  to review  the problem  and  national  and  international  priorities, 
and to report  to the Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly.
