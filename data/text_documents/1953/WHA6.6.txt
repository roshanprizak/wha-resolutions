WHA6.6  Assessment  of China 
The Sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
I. Having  considered  the  report  of the  Executive  Board  7 on the  communication  from  the Republic 
of China8  containing  proposals  which  would  enable  China  to resume  active  participation  in the 
Organization, 
WELCOMES  the return  of China  to active  participation  ; 
II. Taking  into  account  the present  situation  of the Republic  of China,  which  makes  it difficult  for that 
Government  to fulfil  at this  time  its total  financial  obligations  to the World  Health  Organization, 
1. RESOLVES  : 
(1) that  for the purpose  of establishing  the scale  of assessments  for 1954  the assessment  of China 
shall  remain  at 720  units  ; 
(2) that,  until  China's  financial  situation  has  improved,  a payment  of an annual  sum  of not less  than 
$10,000  shall  be considered  adequate  to avoid  the application  of Article  7 of the Constitution  ; 
(3) that,  notwithstanding  the provisions  of Financial  Regulation  5.6,  the payment  by China  of this 
amount  for  1954  shall  be credited  to income  for the year  concerned  rather  than  to the  arrears  of 
earlier  years  ; and,  further, 
(4) that  the  special  provisions  made  in (2) and  (3) above  shall  be reconsidered  by the  Executive 
Board  and/or  the Health  Assembly,  in 1954  ; 
2. DECIDES  : 
(1) that  the payment  of the equivalent  of US $125,000,  to be applied  to the arrears  due  to the Organization  for 1953  and prior  years,  shall  be accepted  ; and  further  that,  notwithstanding  the provisions 
of Financial  Regulation  5.6,  this  payment  shall  be credited  to the assessment  of 1948  ; and 
(2) that  the balance  of the arrears  of China  for the years  prior  to 1954  together  with  the amount 
remaining  unpaid  for 1954  shall  be subject  to future  arrangements,  when  the financial  condition  of 
this country  improves.
