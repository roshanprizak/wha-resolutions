the Assembly 
The Twenty-third  World  Health  Assembly 
ADOPTS  the following  amendments  to its Rules  of Procedure  : 
Rule 34 
The main  committees  of the Health  Assembly  shall  be: 
(a) Committee  A—to  deal  predominantly  with  programme  and  budget  matters; 
(b) Committee  В一to  deal  predominantly  with  administrative,  financial  and  legal  matters. 
In addition  to these  two  main  committees,  the Health  Assembly  may  establish  such  other  main  committees  as it may  consider  necessary. 
The Health  Assembly,  after  consideration  of the recommendations  of the Board  and  the General  Committee,  shall  allocate  items  of the  agenda  to the  two  main  committees  in such  a way  as to provide  an 
appropriate  balance  in the work  of these  committees. 
The chairmen  of these  main  committees  shall  be elected  by the Health  Assembly  after  consideration  of 
the report  of the Committee  on Nominations. 
Rule 52 
The reports  of all committees  established  to consider  items  of the agenda  shall,  before  being  submitted 
to a plenary  meeting,  be referred  to the General  Committee,  or to a drafting  committee  appointed  by it, for 
co-ordinating.  Such  reports,  including  draft  resolutions,  shall,  after  being  examined  by the General  Committee,  be distributed,  in so far as practicable,  at least  twenty-four  hours  in advance  of the plenary  meeting 
at which  they  are to be considered,  unless  the General  Committee  decides,  on procedural  grounds,  to refer 
the report  or the draft  for re-examination  to the competent  committee.  Such  reports,  including  draft  resolutions  annexed  thereto,  shall  not be read  aloud  in the plenary  meeting,  unless  the President  decides  otherwise.
