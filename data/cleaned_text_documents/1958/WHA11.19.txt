) The Eleventh World Health Assembly, Having considered the United Nations resolution 1221 (XII), which expresses the hope that the appropriate legislative authorities of WHO will reconsider the date from which changes in the cost of living at Geneva should be measured in determining the post adjustment for its staff members; Believing that it is in the interest of the United Nations family of organizations to preserve the common system; Believing that where differences arise such questions should be examined within the existing framework for co-ordination between the United Nations and the specialized agencies, REQUESTS the Director-General to raise in the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination at its next meeting the question of the variation at present existing between United Nations and WHO staff members in the dates from which changes in the cost of living at Geneva should be measured, with a view to restoring the common system.
