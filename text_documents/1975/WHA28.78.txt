WHA28.78  Assistance  to newly  independent  and  emerging  States  in Africa 
The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  studied  the  situation  resulting  from  the recent  changes  in the  world,  particularly  in southern 
Africa; 
Considering  that  the countries  newly  freed  from  Portuguese  colonialism  have  to cope  with  the sombre 
legacy  that  results  from  a struggle  for national  liberation; 
Recalling  resolution  3294  (XXIX)  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly; 
Considering,  too,  the absence  of adequate  health  structures  and  the collapse  of the existing  structures 
as a result  of the war; 
Bearing  in mind  the fact  that  the situation  has  been  considerably  aggravated  as a result  of the natural 
catastrophes  that  have  occurred  in Guinea-Bissau,  the  Cape  Verde  Islands,  Mozambique,  Angola  and  the 
islands  of Sâo  Tomé  and  Principe; 
Bearing  also  in mind  the guiding  principles  and  objectives  of WHO's  activities  in the health  field,  particularly  in the rural  areas, 
1. RESOLVES： 
(1) that  a programme  of emergency  assistance  shall  be prepared  by WHO  in cooperation  with  the 
governments  concerned  for the former  Portuguese  colonies  ； 
(2) that  such  technical  assistance  as they  should  require  shall  be made  available  to the governments  of 
those  countries  ； 
(3) that  material  assistance  shall  be afforded  for the establishment  of adequate  health  structures  and 
the strengthening  of the existing  structures,  particularly  in the rural  areas  according  to the plans  of the 
governments  concerned  ； 
(4) that  WHO  shall  participate  actively  in the programmes  of preventive  medicine  that  these  countries 
see fit to undertake  ； 
(5) that  the United  Nations,  UNDP  and  the specialized  agencies  shall  be asked  to contribute  as far 
as possible  to these  programmes  of action; 
(6) that  all these  forms  of assistance  shall  be provided  in the  most  rapid  and  flexible  way  possible 
through  simplified  procedures  ； 
2. APPEALS  earnestly  to all Member  States  to support  by voluntary  contributions  this  emergency  operation; 
3. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to finance  special  expanded  programmes  to these  countries  from  the 
funds  available  to the  Organization,  notably  the  Voluntary  Fund  for  Health  Promotion—including  the 
resources  that  have  accrued  in the  Special  Account  for  Disasters  and  Natural  Catastrophes—the  funds 
available  under  the Director-General's  Development  Programme,  any  savings  that  are made  and,  if necessary, 
the Executive  Board  Special  Fund  ； and 
4. FURTHER  REQUESTS  the  Director-General  : 
(1) to endeavour  by every  possible  means  to obtain  the support  of governmental  and  nongovernmental 
sources  for this  operation  ； and 
(2) to submit  to the  fifty-seventh  session  of the  Executive  Board  and  to the  Twenty-ninth  World 
Health  Assembly  a report  on the measures  taken  and  the assistance  afforded  to these  countries.
