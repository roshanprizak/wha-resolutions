HO The Third World Health Assembly, Taking into consideration the fact that, as the result of an extension of the activities of WHO into numerous beneficial channels, it is becoming increasingly clear that the small budget of a few million dollars which the Organization is able to secure from its Member States is altogether insufficient to enable it to carry out an adequate programme of action designed to fulfil its objectives, and the consequent need for exploring fresh sources of income, 1. SUGGESTS to Member States, after consultation with and under the guidance of the Executive Board, to adopt a suitable scheme for the issue of special World Health stamps or labels for purchase by the public ona purely voluntary basis during such period or periods as the Members may consider convenient, the monies thus raised being divided between the World Health Organization and the country concerned on an agreed basis ; 2. FURTHER SUGGESTS to Member States the possibility of raising funds by the sale of flags on World Health Day; 3. REFERS the above suggestions to the Executive Board for consideration so that a suitable plan maybe developed and transmitted to governments.
