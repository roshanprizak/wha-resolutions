ERADICATION  OF DRACUNCULIASIS 
The Forty-fourth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA39.21  and WHA42.29; 
Having considered  the report of the Director-General  on the eradication  of 
dracunculiasis； 
Encouraged  by the considerable  progress  achieved  in many countries  towards 
elimination  of the disease； 
Aware that country-by-country  elimination  of dracunculiasis  is considered  to be the 
last step before global eradication  can be declared; 
Recognizing  the support  to national  control  activities  provided  by the international 
community; 
Deploring,  none the less, the continuing  adverse  effects  of dracunculiasis  on 
health, including  that of mothers  and children,  as well as its constraining  effects  on 
agriculture,  sustainable  development  and education  in endemic  areas of Africa and Asia, 
where over 100 million  persons  remain at risk of infection; 
Aware that in the face of such problems  a number of countries  have set national 
goals aimed at ensuring  that by the end of 1995 they have no more indigenous  cases； 
1. EXPRESSES  its satisfaction  with the progress  made by affected  Member States in 
eliminating  dracunculiasis； 
2. DECLARES  its commitment  to the goal of eradicating  dracunculiasis  by the end of 
1995, this being technically  feasible  given appropriate  political,  social and economic 
support； 
3. ENDORSES  a combined  strategy  of provision  of safe water, active surveillance,  health 
education,  community  mobilization,  vector control,  and personal  prophylaxis； 
4. CALLS  ON all Member States still affected  by dracunculiasis  to determine  the full 
extent of the disease  and elaborate  regional  plans of action;  establish  intersectoral 
steering  committees；  initiate  certification  of elimination;  coordinate  the 
contributions  of the international  community,  including  multilateral  and bilateral 
agencies  and nongovernmental  organizations；  and explore  possibilities  for mobilizing 
additional  resources  to eradicate  the infection  within the context  of primary  health 
care ； 
5. INVITES  donors,  including  bilateral  and international  development  agencies, 
nongovernmental  organizations,  foundations  and appropriate  regional  organizations,  to 
continue  to support  countries'  efforts  to eradicate  dracunculiasis  by helping  to ensure 
that funds are available  to accelerate  and sustain  them;
