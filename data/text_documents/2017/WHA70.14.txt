 
  SEVENTIETH  WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY  WHA 70.14 
Agenda item 14.1  31 May 2017 
Strengthening immunization to achieve the goals of 
the global vaccine action plan  
 
The Seventieth  World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on the global vaccine action plan;1 
Recalling resolutions WHA65.17 (2012) and WHA68.6 (2015) on the global vaccine action 
plan; and resolution WHA67.23 (2015) on health intervention and technology assessment;  
Welcomin g the declaration by the International Expert Committee for Documenting and 
Verifying Measles, Rubella and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Elimination, that the Member States in 
the Region of the Americas have achieved the interruption of endemic transmission of both rubella 
and measles viruses,2 in 2015 and 2016, respectively;  
Welcoming the validation of the elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus in all districts in 
all 11 Member States of the South- East Asia Region;  
Having considered the 2016 assessment  report from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on 
immunization on the implementation of the global vaccine action plan and progress towards its stated 
strategic objectives and goals;3 
Noting that although many countries have achieved the 2015 goals of the global vaccine action 
plan, and that others are making substantial progress, indicating that while the goals and targets are 
ambitious, they are achievable, the 2016 assessment report from the Strategic Advisory Group of 
Experts on immunization  concl uded that progress is not on track and that only one of the 
six mid-decade targets of the action plan was met;  
Noting the progress made on the introduction of new vaccines and the impact that these 
vaccines have at the individual level and, when high vacci nation rates are achieved,  at the population 
level, in reducing morbidity and/or mortality from vaccine -preventable diseases, such as pneumonia, 
diarrhoea and cervical cancer;

Concerned that at the mid -point of the Decade of Vaccines (2011−2020), progress toward the 
goals of the global vaccine action plan to eradicate polio, eliminate measles and rubella, eliminate 
maternal and neonatal tetanus, and increase equitable access to affordable, life- saving vaccines is too 
slow; and recognizing that middle -income  countries, in particular, have faced specific challenges with 
the introduction of new vaccines;  
Noting that although Member States in all six WHO regions have measles elimination goals, 
and that three regions have rubella elimination goals, additional eff orts should be invested to reach 
measles and rubella elimination;  
Recognizing the important contribution of vaccines and immunization to: improving the health 
of populations; achieving the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals; ensuring outbreak 
prepared ness and response, including in respect of outbreaks involving emerging pathogens; and 
tackling antimicrobial resistance;  
Recognizing that strong health systems and integrated routine immunization programmes that 
are well coordinated across other relevant  sectors contribute to achieving immunization goals and 
targets, and universal health coverage;  
Recognizing the significant progress achieved towards polio eradication and the significant 
contribution of the polio -related assets, human resources and infrastructure, which should be 
transitioned effectively, to the strengthening of national immunization and health systems;  
Recognizing the need for enhanced international cooperation aimed at, in a sustainable manner, 
strengthening the capacities of developing countries to achieve the goals of the global vaccine action 
plan,  
1. URGES Member States:1 
(1) to demonstrate stronger leadership and governance of national immunization 
programmes  by: 
(a) increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of national immunization programmes, 
as an integrated part of strong and sustainable health care systems;  
(b) allocating adequate financial and human resources to immunization programmes 
according to national pr iorities; 
(c) strengthening national processes and advisory b odies for independent, 
evidence- based, transparent advice, including on vaccine safety and effectiveness, such as 
health intervention and technology assessments and/or National Immunization Technical 
Advisory Groups working in collaboration with national regulatory authorities;  
(d) strengthening mechanisms to monitor and efficiently manage vaccination 
programme funds at all levels;  
1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations.

(e) making up -to-date and accurate information on the effectivenes s and safety of 
vaccines publicly available;  
(f) strengthening systems to monitor and deal with adverse events following 
immunization ;  
(g) promoting awareness -raising campaigns on immunization, underlining public 
health benefits  and vaccine safety and ef fectiveness;  
(h) strengthening the immunization systems, procedures and policies that are necessary 
to achieve and sustain high immunization coverage;  
(i) reviewing periodically, through the National Immunization Technical Advisory 
Groups or equivalent in dependent groups, the progress made, including immunization 
coverage, lessons learned and possible solutions for dealing with remaining challenges;  
(j) continuing to report on progress to the regional committees, as urged in 
resolution WHA65.17;  
(2) to ens ure use of up -to-date data including, where possible, sex- disaggregated data on 
immunization coverage to guide strategic and programmatic decisions that protect at -risk 
populations and reduce disease burden;  
(3) to strengthen and sustain surveillance capac ity by investing in disease detection and 
notification systems, routine analysis and data reporting systems;  
(4) to expand immunization services beyond infancy to cover the whole life course, as 
appropriate, guided by evidence, including on the burden of d isease, cost effectiveness, budget 
impact assessment and system capacities, and using the most appropriate and effective means of 
reaching the other age groups and high- risk populations with immunization and integrated 
health services;  
(5) to strengthen international and national actions to ensure the application of the 
International Health Regulations (2005), which aim to prevent, protect against, control and
