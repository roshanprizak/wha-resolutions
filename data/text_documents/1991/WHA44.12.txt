Having considered  the report of the Committee  of the Executive  Board to Consider

Republic,  Equatorial  Guinea,  Grenada,  Guatemala,  Guinea-Bissau,  Iraq, Liberia,

privileges  of these Members  should be suspended; 
Having been informed  that, as a result of payments  received  after the opening  of the
