S The Forty-first World Health Assembly, Recalling previous resolutions of the Health Assembly concerning Members in arrears in the payment of their contributions to an extent which would justify invoking Article 7 of the Constitution and, in particular, resolutions WHA8.13, WHA16.20 (part II) and WHA37.7 (paragraph 4) ADOPTS the following statement of the principles that it intends henceforth to follow: APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE CONSTITUTION IN THE CASE OF FAILURE TO MEET FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS 1. Towards the end of the year preceding each Health Assembly, the Director-General will invite Members that will, unless corrective action is taken, be in arrears to an extent which would justify invoking Article 7 of the Constitution pursuant to resolution WHA8.13, to submit to the Executive Board a statement of their intentions as to the payment of arrears so that the Health Assembly, when it considers whether or not the right of vote of those Members is tobe suspended, can make its decision on the basis of the statements of the Members and the recommendations of the Executive Board. 2. Unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying a different measure, the Health Assembly will adopt a decision, by a two-thirds majority pursuant to Rule 72 of the Rules of Procedure of the Health Assembly, under which the voting rights of a Member in arrears to the extent referred to in paragraph 1 above will be suspended as from the opening day of the following Health Assembly if at that time the Member is still in arrears to the extent referred to. If the Member is no longer in arrears to the said extent, the decision will lapse and the suspension will not take effect. Any suspension will be without prejudice to the right to request restoration pursuant to Article 7 of the Constitution. Fourteenth plenary meeting, 11 May 1988 A41 / VR / 14
