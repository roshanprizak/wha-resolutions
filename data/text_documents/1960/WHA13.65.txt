WHA13.65 World  Health  Year 
The Thirteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that  the  number  and  importance  of health  projects  currently  undertaken  or planned 
require  the use of all resources  available  if they  are to be brought  to a successful  conclusion; 
Considering  that  the  efforts  and  expenditure  involved  in the holding  of a World  Health  Year  are 
unlikely  to be commensurate  with  the benefit  which  the people  would  derive  from  this  year; 
Believing  that  these  efforts  would  be better  applied  to a critical  review  and  evaluation  of programme 
and projects, 
RECOMMENDS  that  the holding  of a World  Health  Year  be postponed.
