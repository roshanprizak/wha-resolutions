WHA25.7  Members  in arrears  in the  payment  of their  contributions  to an extent  which  may  invoke  Article  7 
of the  Constitution 
The Twenty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Ad Hoc  Committee  of the Executive  Board  on Members  in arrears 
in the payment  of their  contributions  to an extent  which  may  invoke  the  provisions  of Article  7 of the 
Constitution;1 
Having  noted  with  regret  and  concern  that  Bolivia,  the Dominican  Republic,  El Salvador  and  Paraguay 
are in arrears  to such  an extent  that  it is necessary  for the Assembly  to consider,  in accordance  with  Article  7 
of the Constitution,  whether  or not the voting  privileges  of these  Members  should  be suspended; 
Recognizing  the efforts  made  by Bolivia,  El Salvador  and  Paraguay  to liquidate  their  arrears  ； 
Noting  that  the Dominican  Republic  has made  no payment  to the Organization  in respect  of its assessed 
contributions  since  1966  and that,  as a result,  the Dominican  Republic  is in arrears  for the balance  of its 1965 
contribution  and  for the full  contributions  for the years  1966  to 1971  ； 
Noting,  however,  that  the Dominican  Republic  has  proposed  a plan  for the settlement  of its arrears 
to the effect  that  its 1971  contribution  be liquidated  and  that  its consolidated  arrears  of contributions  for 
the period  1965-1970  be paid  in four  equal  instalments  in the years  1972-1975，subject  to the provisions  of 
Financial  Regulation  5.5 and notwithstanding  the provisions  of Financial  Regulation  5.6 and that  an assurance 
has been  given  to start  implementing  before  the end  of 1972  its proposal  for settlement  of its arrears, 
1. DECIDES  not  to suspend  the  voting  privileges  of Bolivia,  the  Dominican  Republic,  El Salvador  and 
Paraguay  at the Twenty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly  ； 
2. URGES  Bolivia,  the Dominican  Republic,  El Salvador  and  Paraguay  to regularize  their  position  so that 
the Executive  Board  at its fifty-first  session  and  the  Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly  will  not  have  to 
examine  this  question  again  ； and 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to communicate  this  resolution  to the Members  concerned.
