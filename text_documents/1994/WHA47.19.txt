FORTY-SEVENTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY WHA47.19 
Agenda  item  26.3 12 May  1994 
Status  of collection  of assessed  contributions  and 
status  of advances  to the Working  Capital  Fund 
The Forty-seventh  World Health Assembly, 
Noting with concern that, as at 31 December  1993: 
(a) the rate of collection  in 1993 of contributions  to the effective  working  budget for that year 
amounted  to 79.03%,  leaving US$ 74 517 451 unpaid; 
(b) only 95 Members  had paid their contributions  to the effective  working budget for that year in 
full, and 71 Members  had made no payment; 
(c) unpaid  contributions  to the effective  working budget in respect of the financial  period 1992-1993 
amounted  to US$ 106 million, 
1. EXPRESSES  concern  at the level of outstanding  contributions,  which has had a deleterious  effect on 
programmes  and on the financial  situation; 
2. CALLS  THE ATTENTION  of all Members  to Financial  Regulation  5.6, which provides  that 
instalments  of contributions  and advances  shall be considered  as due and payable in full by the first day of 
the year to which they relate, and to the importance  of paying contributions  as early as possible to enable 
the Director-General  to implement  the programme  budget in an orderly manner; 
3. REMINDS  Members  that, as a result of the adoption,  by resolution  WHA41.12,  of an incentive 
scheme to promote  the timely payment  of assessed  contributions,  those that pay their assessed  contributions 
early in the year in which they are due will have their contributions  payable for a subsequent  programme 
budget reduced appreciably,  whereas  Members  paying later will have their contributions  payable for that 
subsequent  programme  budget reduced only marginally  or not at all; 
4. URGES  Members  that are regularly  late in the payment  of their contributions  to take as rapidly as 
possible all steps necessary  to ensure prompt and regular payment; 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to draw this resolution  to the attention  of all Members.
