Having considered the Report of the Director-General on 
Programme ;WHA32.14 
22 May 1979
2  3  ；1A J 1979
the Occupational Health
Noting with concern the serious increase in occupational and work-related diseases in many 
parts of the world where at the same time occupational health services are either non-existent,  
weak or isolated from general health services ;
Noting further that the health of the worker is a major factor in the well-being of the 
family and community and has a considerable impact on human productivity and socioeconomic 
development ;
Convinced that the field of occupational health calls for a broad multidisciplinary 
approach ;
Recalling that the Alma-Ata Declaration refers to bringing health care as close as 
possible to where people live and work, and convinced that this will require the use of 
resources in industry and other economic activities to enhance health promotion ;
Aware of the opportunities that work has in health promotion and that these have not as 
yet been fully exploited for the improvement of the health of nations ;
Concerned at the uncontrolled introduction of some industrial and agricultural processes 
with physical,  chemical,  biological and psychosocial hazards,  especially in developing 
countries where lower standards of health may further aggravate the situation ;
Stressing that in many countries enterprises and employers do not provide adequate 
resources and facilities for the development of occupational health services, while there 
is inadequate legislation in this field ;
Aware that the health and well-being of the families of workers have a profound influence 
on the health of workers ;
Noting that migrant workers have particular health and social problems as do their 
families both in the countries of employment and their countries of origin ;
Noting that the Report of the Director-General contains important elements and proposes 
new programme areas requiring action by WHO, as well as coordination within WHO and with ILO 
and other United Nations agencies and organizations ;
Noting also that technology and standards in occupational health are in need of 
coordination and adaptation to conditions in developing countries,  and that the rapid 
increase of toxic agents and biological hazards in work-places and of occupational hazards 
require more intensive efforts by WHO and countries ;
