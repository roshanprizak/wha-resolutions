WHA31.47  The  role  of the health  sector  in the development  of national  and  international  food  and  nutrition policies  and  plans,  with  special  reference  to combating  malnutrition 
The Thirty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  Director-General's  report  on the role  of the health  sector  in the development  of 
national  and  international  food  and  nutrition  policies  and  plans; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA27.43,  WHA28.42  and  WHA30.51; 
Convinced  that  malnutrition  is one  of the major  impediments  in attaining  the goal  of health  for all by 
the year  2000,  and  that  new  approaches  based  on clearly  defined  priorities  and  maximum  utilization  of local 
resources  are needed  for a more  effective  action  to combat  malnutrition; 
Noting  with  concern  the continued  decline  in breast-feeding  in many  countries,  while  in certain  countries 
it has been  possible  to arrest  or reverse  this  trend  ； 
Recognizing  that  during  the first  months  of life breast-feeding  is the safest  and  most  appropriate  way  to 
feed infants  and  that  it should  be maintained  as long  as possible,  with  timely  supplementation  and  weaning 
which  ideally  should  be done  with  locally  available  and  acceptable  foods; 
1. THANKS  the Director-General  for his report  ； 
2. ENDORSES  the functions  of the health  sector  in this  field,  as described  in the report  of the Director-General  ； 
3. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  States  give  the  highest  priority  to stimulating  permanent  multisectoral 
coordination  of nutrition  policies  and  programmes  and  to preventing  malnutrition  in pregnant  and  lactating 
women,  infants  and  young  children  by: 
(1) supporting  and  promoting  breast-feeding  by educational  activities  among  the  general  public; 
legislative  and  social  action  to facilitate  breast-feeding  by working  mothers  ； implementing  the necessary 
promotional  and  facilitating  measures  in the health  services  ； and  regulating  inappropriate  sales  promotion 
of infant  foods  that  can  be used  to replace  breast  milk; 
(2) ensuring  timely  supplementation  and  appropriate  weaning  practices  and  the  feeding  of young 
children  after  weaning  with  the maximum  utilization  of locally  available  and  acceptable  foods;  carrying 
out, if necessary,  action-oriented  research  to support  this  approach;  and  training  personnel  for  its 
promotion; 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to develop,  in cooperation  with  Member  States,  a programme  of research  and  development  in 
nutrition,  oriented  primarily  to the needs  of developing  countries,  and  aimed  initially  at the prevention 
of malnutrition  in pregnant  and  lactating  women  and  in young  children  by promoting  adequate  nutrition 
of the mother  and  by encouraging  breast-feeding  and  timely  supplementation  and  appropriate  weaning 
practices,  with  the maximum  utilization  of locally  available  and  acceptable  foods; 
(2) to take  any  necessary  measures  to coordinate  international  activities  designed  to promote  breastfeeding,  and  especially  to work  in close  collaboration  with  other  United  Nations  agencies  active  in this 
field; 
(3) to cooperate  with  national  institutions  in their  problem-solving  research  and  training  programmes 
so as to strengthen  their  capacity  to combat  malnutrition,  and  to stimulate  technical  cooperation  among 
developing  countries  in this  field; 
(4) to collaborate  with  multilateral  and  bilateral  organizations  and  agencies  and  with  other  intergovernmental  and  nongovernmental  organizations  in programmes  of technical  cooperation  with  countries 
for the development  and  implementation  of national  food  and  nutrition  policies,  plans  and  programmes  ； 
(5) to stimulate  the  mobilization  of scientific  and  financial  resources  in support  of a global  effort  to 
eliminate  malnutrition; 
5. URGES  governments,  multilateral  and  bilateral  organizations  and  agencies  to support  the proposed  programme  of research  and  development  in nutrition  through  their  technical  and  scientific  institutions  and 
workers  and  by financial  contributions.'
