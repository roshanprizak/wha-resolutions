The Twenty-fifth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Director-General Recalling resolutions WHA19.39 and WHA24.31 which emphasize the role of national health authorities, and of WHO at the international level, in the field of the medical uses of ionizing radiation, including protection from radiation hazards Noting the need for medical radiological services tobe improved as an integral part of national health services, particularly in the context of basic health services Recognizing that the optimal use of ionizing radiation in medicine in many countries is hampered by the shortage of trained manpower, 1. INVITES Member States to cooperate and participate in research on the effects of ionizing radiation with a view to improving medical practice and to protecting the population against the adverse effects of ionizing radiation; 2. RECOMMENDS that Member States : (1) give attention to promoting radiation medicine : (a) by developing, as part of their national health services and in the light of their priority needs, facilities for radiodiagnosis, radiotherapy and nuclear medicine (b) by developing adequate undergraduate and postgraduate training of physicians in radiological methods, introducing, where necessary, formal training for medical physicists and emphasizing the training of radiological technicians (2) establish and review periodically priorities in the programme of radiation medicine at the local and national levels; (3) consider the establishment of legislation and surveillance services to ensure the most appropriate use of ionizing radiation and radioisotopes in medicine and for other purposes; 3. REQUESTS the Director-General : (1) to continue technical assistance, where necessary, to governments of Member States in the development of radiation medicine, including : (a) assistance and advice for the planning of radiation medicine, including appropriate radiation protection, within the national health programmes and (b) the development of plans and curricula for the training of students and personnel in radiation medicine and radiation protection, aswell as support for training centres (2) to promote the establishment of reference centres for dosimetry applied to the various forms of radiation medicine, including radiation protection; (3) to continue in cooperation with UNSCEAR, IAEA and other international organizations, as appropriate, to evaluate the world situation as regards the medical use of ionizing radiation and the effects of radiation exposure on populations and (4) to report toa future session of the World Health Assembly on the results of his evaluation.
