The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  the recommendations  of the WHO  Expert  Committee  on Drug  Dependence  that  met  in Geneva 
from  8 to 13 October  1973;  1 
Noting  the trend  toward  increasing  levels  of alcohol  consumption  in some  of the industrialized  and  the 
developing  countries  and  the consequent  health  hazards  which  require  new  initiatives  at the international  and 
national  levels  ； 
Noting  the association  between  the  level  of alcohol  consumption  and  certain  forms  of health  damage, 
resulting  in the  increase  of morbidity  and  mortality  (e.g.,  mental  disorders,  liver  disease,  accidents  and 
injuries); 
Recognizing  that  a basic  ingredient  in the  formulation  of a national  public-health-oriented  alcohol 
policy  is reliable  statistical  information  on alcohol  consumption  and  certain  forms  of health  damage  ； 
Bearing  in mind  the  need  to broaden  the  scope  of health  statistical  information  to comprise  not  only 
disease  entities  or specific  conditions  but  also  other  indicators  of health  and  social  wellbeing, 
1. URGES  Member  States  to promote  the  development  of information  systems  on alcohol  consumption 
and other  relevant  data  needed  as a basis  for a public-health-oriented  alcohol  policy;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  : 
(1) to direct  special  attention  in the future  programme  of WHO  to the extent  and  seriousness  of the 
individual,  public  health  and  social  problems  associated  with  the current  use of alcohol  in many  countries 
of the world  and  the trend  toward  higher  levels  of consumption; 
(2) to take  steps,  in cooperation  with  competent  international  and  national  organizations  and  bodies, 
to develop  comparable  information  systems  on alcohol  consumption  and  other  relevant  data  needed 
for a public-health-oriented  alcohol  policy; 
(3) to study  in depth,  on the basis  of such  information,  what  measures  could  be taken  in order  to control 
the increase  in alcohol  consumption  involving  danger  to public  health; 
(4) to report  on this  matter  to a coming  session  of the World  Health  Assembly.
