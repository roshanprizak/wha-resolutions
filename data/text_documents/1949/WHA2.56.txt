WHA2.56.  Policy  to be followed  concerning  Contributions  in arrears 
The Second  World  Health  Assembly 
RESOLVES  to adopt  the  following  policy  and  procedure  when  the  contribution  to 
be paid  by a Member  is in arrears  : 
When  the contribution  has  not been  paid  by any  Member  in full  by the  end  of the 
year  for which  the  assessment  is made,  that  Member  shall  be considered  to be in 
arrears.  When  any  Member  is in arrears,  the Director-General  shall  communicate 
with  the Member  concerned  to ascertain  the reasons  for the delay  in payment  and 
what  arrangements  can  be made  for payment.  He  shall  submit  to the next  session 
of the  Executive  Board  a report  on the  result  of his enquiries. 
When  the contribution  has  not been  paid  by any  Member  in full  by the end  of the 
year  following  the  year  for which  the  assessment  is made,  that  Member  shall  be 
considered  to be in arrears  for one  year,  warranting  consideration  by the  next 
convened  meeting  of the  World  Health  Assembly. 
A full  report  on the circumstances  of the  case  shall  be furnished  by the Executive 
Board  to the  World  Health  Assembly  and  the  Health  Assembly  may,  after  consideration  of that  report,  take  such  action,  if any,  as it considers  necessary  and 
appropriate,  by invoking  all or part  of Article  7 of the  Constitution.
