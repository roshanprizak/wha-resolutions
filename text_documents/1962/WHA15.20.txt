WHA15.20  Development  of the  Malaria  Eradication  Programme:  Acceleration  of the  Programme  from  Con-tinued  Voluntary  Contributions 
The Fifteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Bearing  in mind  that  the advances  in knowledge,  methodology  and  techniques  of malaria  eradication 
operations  now  enable  WHO  to assist  in the solution  of technical  and  operational  problems  of the eradication of this  disease  in all parts'of  the world, 
Recognizing  that  the  rapid  undertaking  of new  malaria  eradication  programmes,  the  speeding-up  of 
the projects  already  under  way  and  the accelerated  promotion  of pre-eradication  programmes  in Africa  are 
of primary  importance  for shortening  the time  needed  for total  malaria  eradication; 
Having  reviewed  the report  of the Director-General2  on the possible  acceleration  of the malaria  eradication  programme, 
1. NOTES  the report;2  and 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to implement  the activities  outlined  in the report  in so far as they  conform 
to the accepted  principles  of assistance  by the Organization  and  to the extent  to which  financial  resources 
become  available  in the  Malaria  Eradication  Special  Account  and  suitable  staff  is forthcoming.
