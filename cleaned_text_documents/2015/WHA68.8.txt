The Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report on health and the environment: addressing the health impact of air pollution ;1 Reaffirming its commitment to the outcome document of the Rio+20 Conference The future we want, in which all States Members of the United Nations committed to promoting sustainable development policies that support healthy air quality in the context of sustainable cities and human settlements, and recognized that reducing air pollution leads to positive effects on health;2 Noting with deep concern that indoor and outdoor air pollution are both among the leading avoidable causes of disease and death globally, and the worlds largest single environmental health risk;3 Acknowledging that 4.3 million deaths occur each year from exposure to household (indoor) air pollution and that 3.7 million deaths each year are attributable to ambient (outdoor) air pollution, at a high cost to societies;4 Aware that exposure to air pollutants, including fine particulate matter, is a leading risk factor for noncommunicable diseases in adults, including ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and cancer, and poses a considerable health threat to current and future generations; Concerned that half the deaths due to acute lower respiratory infections, including pneumonia in children aged less than five years, maybe attributed to household air pollution, making it a leading risk factor for childhood mortality; 1 Document A68 / 18. 2 UNEA resolution 1 / 7, PP6 . 3 Global Health Observatory (accessed 18 March 2015 ). 4 WHO. Burden of disease from ambient air pollution for 2012. databases / AAP_BoD_results_March2014.pdf?ua=1 (accessed 1 December 2014). WHA6 8.8 2 Further concerned that air pollution, including fine particulate mat ter, is classified as a cause of lung cancer by WHOs International Agency on Research for Cancer ;1 Aware that both short- and long-term exposure to air pollution has a negative impact on public health, with a much greater impact resulting from long-term exposure and exposure at high levels, causing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and also that for many pollutants, such as particles, long-term exposure even at low le vels (below WHO air quality guidelines proposed levels) could result in some adverse health effects; Noting the strong significance of air pollution and its health effects for the objectives and targets contained in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013 2020, aswell as the significance of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, in particular Article 8 and its Guidelines related to the protection from exposure to tobacco smoke, as applicable the parties of the Convention; Noting that air pollution is a cause of global health inequities, affecting in particular women, children and old persons, aswell as low-income populations who are often exposed to high levels of ambient air pollution, or live in homes that have no other choice than tobe exposed to air pollution from cooking and heating, and that improving air quality is among the measures with the greatest potential impact on health equity;2 Cognizant that most air pollutants are emitted as a result of the human activities identified as sources of air pollution3 in the WHO guidelines on ambient and indoor air pollution, and that there are also naturally occurring phenomena that negatively affect air quality and noting that there is a significant interrelation between outdoor and indoor air quality; Aware that promoting energy efficiency and expanding the use of clean and renewable energy can have co-benefits for health and sustainable development and stressing that the affordability of this energy will help maximize these opportunities; Underscoring that the root causes of air pollution and its adverse impacts are predominantly socioeconomic in nature, and cognizant of the need to address the social determinants of health related to development in urban and rural settings, including poverty eradication, as an indispensable element for sustainable development and for the reduction of the health impact of air pollution; Emphasizing the importance of promotion, transfer and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies, particularly to developing countries, to address the health impact of air pollution; 1 IARC Monographs Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans on the following issues: Outdoor Air Pollution (2013, Volume 109); Diesel and gasoline exhausts and some nitroarenes (2012, Volume 105); Household use of solid fuels and high-temperature frying (2010, Volume 95); Indoor emissions from household combustion of coal (2012, Volume 100E); Tobacco smoke and involuntary smoking (2004, Volume 83). 2 WHO Burden of Disease, Indoor and Outdoor Air Pollution, 2014 . 3 WHO Guidelines for Air Quality: Global Update 20 05; WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion; WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality: select pollutants; WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: Dampness and Mould. 4 These include, inter alia, Radon, [a carcinogenic], dust- and sands torms, volcanic eruptions and forest fires. WHA6 8.8 3 Acknowledging recent global efforts to promote air quality, in particular the 2014 United Nations Environment Assembly resolution on air quality , aswell as the many national and regional initiatives to mitigate the health impacts of indoor and outdoor air pollution, and noting that regional and subregional cooperation frameworks provide good opportunities to address air quality issues according to the specific circumstances of each region; Recognizing that in order to contribute to national policy choices that protect health and reduce health inequities, the health sector will need to engage incross-sectoral approaches to health, including adopti ng a health-in-all policies approach;1 Noting that WHOs air quality guidelines for both ambient air quality2 (2005) and indoor air quality3 (2014) provide guidance and recommendations for clean air that protect human health, and recognizing that these need tobe supported by activities, such as the promotion and facilitation of implementation; Acknowledging that while many of the most important and cost-effective actions against outdoor and indoor air pollution require the involvement and leadership of national governments aswell as regional and local authorities, cities are both particularly affected by the consequences of air pollution and well-placed to promote healthy city activities to reduce air pollution and its associated health impacts, and can develop good practices, complement and implement national measures; Acknowledging that mobilizing national and, as appropriate, international resources is important for re-tooling relevant infrastructure that contributes to air pollution reduction is an integral element of global sustainable development, and that air pollution-related health impacts can be a health-relevant indicator for sustainable development policies; Aware that promoting air quality is apriority to protect health and provide co-benefits for the climate, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and food security;4 Acknowledging also the complexity between improving air quality and reducing emissions of warming climate-altering pollutants, and that there can be meaningful opportunities to achieve co-benefits resulting from these actions; Underlining that higher temperatures, heatwaves, dust- and sandstorms, volcanic eruptions and forest fires can also exacerbate the impact of anthropogenic air pollution on health, 1 Taking into account the context of federated states. 2 WHO air quality guidelines for particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide WHO Air Quality Guidelines Global Update 2005 : summary frisk assessment.
