WHA6.15  Selection  of Non-Proprietary  Names  for Drugs 
The Sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  that  the wide  acceptance  of non-proprietary  names  for drugs  serves  the best  interests  of 
world  health,  assists  the growth  of international  commerce  in drug  products,  and  constitutes  an additional 
basis  for improved  international  relations  ; 
Recognizing  at the same  time  that  safeguards  are necessary  in any  procedure  for the selection  of nonproprietary  names,  to ensure  the protection  of proper  rights  which  may  be affected  by the adoption  of the 
names  recommended, 
REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  at its twelfth  session,  taking  into  account  those  resolutions  of the World 
Health  Assembly  and  the Executive  Board  which  pertain  to the selection  and  adoption  of non-proprietary 
names  for drugs  and  pharmaceutical  products,  to review  and  clarify  the procedure  to be followed  for this 
purpose  and  to report  thereon  to the Seventh  World  Health  Assembly. 
(Third  report  of the  Committee  on  Programme  and 
Budget,  adopted  at the ninth  plenary  meeting,  20 May 
1953)
