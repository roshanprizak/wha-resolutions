FORTY-NINTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA49.7 
Agenda  item  21.5  23  May  1996 
Report  of the ad hoc  group 
The Forty-ninth  World Health Assembly, 
Having considered  the report by the Director-General  on WHO reform and response  to global change: 
report of the ad hoc group;1  and the recommendation  contained  in paragraph  3 of resolution  EB97.R10, 
adopted by the Executive  Board at its ninety-seventh  session,  concerning  a change in the Rules of Procedure 
of the World Health Assembly; 
Noting that, as a general principle,  it is not appropriate  to apply such a change to an incumbent 
Director-General; 
Accepting  therefore  the proviso recorded  in paragraph  5 of document  A49/15; 
Noting further that its acceptance  of this proviso does not mean that the Health Assembly  is taking the 
position that the incumbent  Director-General  should in fact serve for a further term; and that the question 
who should serve as Director-General  from July 1998 remains to be decided in accordance  with the relevant 
rules and procedures; 
AMENDS  Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure  of the World Health Assembly  as follows: 
Rule 108 
In pursuance  of Article 31 of the Constitution,  the Director-General  shall be appointed  by the Health 
Assembly  on the nomination  of the Board and on such terms as the Health Assembly  may determine, 
subject to the provisions  of Rules 109 to 112 inclusive.  The term of office of the Director-General 
shall be five years, and he or she shall be eligible for reappointment  once only.
