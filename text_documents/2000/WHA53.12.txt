Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization1
The Fifty-third World Health Assembly,
Noting with deep concern that about 6.8 million children under five years of age die each year
from infectious and parasitic diseases, and that some two million children still die each year from
diseases that can be prevented by currently available vaccines;
Noting that existing immunization programmes currently save about three million lives per year
worldwide and prevent nearly 750 000 cases of blindness, paralysis and mental disability annually;
Recognizing that in some countries immunization rates are stagnating and even declining, and
that great disparity exists between industrialized and developing countries in the availability ofvaccines;
Recognizing that many developing countries cannot afford to pay all the costs associated with
universal childhood immunization and the establishment of safe and efficient delivery systems tocover their child populations;
Acknowledging that immunization is one of the most cost-effective health interventions and that
it contributes to reducing poverty,
1. ENDORSES the objectives of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) – a

Foundation – namely, improving access to sustainable immunization services; expanding the use of all
existing safe and cost-effective vaccines; accelerating the development and introduction of newvaccines; accelerating research and development efforts for vaccines and related products specifically
