WHA18.49  Programme  Activities  in the Health  Aspects  of World  Population  which  might  be developed  by WHO 
The Eighteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the  Director-General  on programme  activities  in the  health  aspects 
of world  population  which  might  be developed  by WHO,1 
Bearing  in mind  Article  2 (/) of the Constitution  which  reads  : " In order  to achieve  its objective,  the 
functions  of the Organization  shall  be...  to promote  maternal  and  child  health  and  welfare  and  to foster 
the ability  to live  harmoniously  in a changing  total  environment  " ; 
Noting  resolution  1048  (XXXVII)  adopted  by the  Economic  and  Social  Council  at its thirty-seventh 
session,  in August  1964; 
Believing  that  demographic  problems  require  the  consideration  of economic,  social,  cultural,  psychological  and  health  factors  in their  proper  perspective; 
Noting  that  the United  Nations  Population  Commission  at its thirteenth  session,  in April  1965,  attached 
high  priority  to the research  and  other  activities  in the field  of fertility; 
Considering  that  the changes  in the size  and  structure  of the population  have  repercussions  on health 
conditions; 
Recognizing  that  problems  of human  reproduction  involve  the  family  unit  as well  as society  as a 
whole,  and  that  the size  of the family  should  be the free  choice  of each  individual  family; 
Bearing  in mind  that  it is a matter  for national  administrations  to decide  whether  and  to what  extent 
they should  support  the provision  of information  and  services  to their  people  on the health  aspects  of human 
reproduction; 
Accepting  that  it is not  the  responsibility  of WHO  to endorse  or promote  any  particular  population 
policy;  and 
Noting  that  the scientific  knowledge  with  regard  to the biology  of human  reproduction  and  the medical 
aspects  of fertility  control  is insufficient, 
1. APPROVES  the  report  of the  Director-General  on programme  activities  in the health  aspects  of world 
population  which  might  be developed  by WHO;1 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to develop  further  the programme  proposed  : 
(a) in  the fields  of reference  services,  studies  on medical  aspects  of sterility  and  fertility  control  methods 
and health  aspects  of population  dynamics;  and 
(b) in  the field  of advisory  services  as outlined  in Part  III,  paragraph  3, of his report,1  on the understanding  that  such  services  are related,  within  the responsibilities  of WHO,  to technical  advice  on the 
health  aspects  of human  reproduction  and  should  not  involve  operational  activities;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to report  to the Nineteenth  World  Health  Assembly  on the programme 
of WHO  in the field  of human  reproduction.
