Having considered the consolidated report by the Director-General;2 Recognizing that epilepsy and other neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years and the second leading cause of death worldwide, and that epilepsy and other neurological disorders have a disproportionate impact on people living in low- and middle-income countries;3 Noting that neurological disorders are conditions of the central and peripheral nervous system that include epilepsy, headache disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, neuroinfectious and/or neuroimmunological disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders and traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries;2 Noting also, with concern, that the risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is three times higher than in the general population and that, over the past 30 years, the absolute number of deaths due to neurological disorders has increased by 39%;4 Acknowledging, as outlined in the WHO, International League Against Epilepsy and International Bureau for Epilepsy global report, Epilepsy: a public health imperative published in 2019, that epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders globally, affecting an estimated 50 million people worldwide across all ages, with increased rates in people who are young and those who are old; Recognizing that epilepsy is a highly treatable condition and that over 70% of people with epilepsy could live seizure-free if they had access to appropriate anti-seizure treatment the most cost-effective of which are included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines; Recalling resolution WHA67.22 (2014) on access to essential medicines, in which the Health Assembly called for action to enhance access to essential medicines, and urged Member States, inter alia, to identify key barriers to access to essential medicines; Noting that, despite the low cost of effective interventions for epilepsy (estimated at less than US$ 5 per person per year), the current treatment gap is over 75% in most low-income countries and 50% in the majority of middle-income countries, and that lack of access to medicines and other effective interventions, and to specialist consultations, coupled with discrimination and stigma associated with this condition, is resulting in disability, mortality, social exclusion, economic disadvantage and negative mental health outcomes in people living with epilepsy; and noting further that tackling epilepsy is widely considered to be a public health imperative, as concluded in the 2019 global report Epilepsy: a public health imperative; 1 See Annex 3 for the financial and administrative implications for the Secretariat of this resolution. 2 Document A73/5. 3 As per the 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study (Global, regional, and national burden of neurological disorders, 19902016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016.

RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 33 Recognizing that approximately 25% of epilepsy cases and a significant proportion of other neurological disorders could be prevented if broader public health actions were taken to strengthen maternal and newborn health care, ensure effective noncommunicable disease control (including promotion of cerebrovascular health and prevention of traumatic brain injuries, as well as prevention of central nervous system infections), and to expand scientific research and training of health professionals; Acknowledging the importance of addressing the preventable causes of epilepsy and other neurological disorders, including by: promoting healthy brain development and functioning over the life course;1 the control of neurocysticercosis and its association with epilepsy;2 the provision of safe environments to avoid traumatic injuries due to accidents, violence or exposure to environmental pollutants;2 and access to medicines to prevent neurological infections, such as tetanus, rabies, HIV-associated neurological disorders and cerebral malaria;3 Recognizing that epilepsy and other neurological disorders often co-exist and can be compounded by other health conditions, that epilepsy, for example, can occur following stroke and traumatic brain injury, that neurological disorders, including epilepsy, are commonly associated with infections such as malaria and meningitis, and that among people with intellectual disabilities one in four also lives with epilepsy; and noting that the WHO global disability action plan 20142021 and WHOs global action plan on the public health response to dementia 20172025 provide useful frameworks for taking a synergistic and complementary approach to tackling some of these co-existing conditions; Noting with concern the significant mental health impact of neurological disorders on affected persons and their families and recalling, therefore, the importance of resolution WHA66.8 (2013), through which the Health Assembly adopted the comprehensive mental health action plan 20132020; Recalling United Nations General Assembly resolution 70/1 (2015) entitled Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development entitled The future we want and the report of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals established pursuant to United Nations General Assembly resolution 66/288 (2012), which includes Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) and target 3.4 (By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being); Recalling also that in order to promote physical and mental health and well-being, and to extend life expectancy for all, we must achieve universal health coverage; Recalling further that we are committed to the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases, including behavioural, developmental and neurological disorders, which constitute a major challenge for sustainable development; 1 See resolution WHA67.10 (2014) on the newborn health action plan; and resolution WHA57.17 (2004) on the global strategy on diet, physical activity and health. 2 See Accelerating work to overcome the global impact of neglected tropical diseases: a roadmap for implementation.
