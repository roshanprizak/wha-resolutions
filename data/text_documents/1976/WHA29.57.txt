WHA29.57  Occupational  health  programme 
The Twenty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  by the  Director-General  on the  occupational  health  programme,  and 
bearing  in mind  earlier  resolutions  on the  subject  by the Health  Assembly  and  the  Executive  Board  ； 
Reaffirming  that  occupational  health  is a component  of public  health  that  should  be closely  coordinated 
with  or integrated  into  national  health  and  industrial  development  programmes; 
Aware  of the pressing  demands  for adequate  occupational  health  services  in a large  number  of Member 
States； 
Conscious  that  there  is a lack  of information  on the type  and  magnitude  of the health  problems  of workers 
in developing  countries; 
Stressing  the fact  that,  despite  the outstanding  need  for Member  States  to develop  effective  occupational 
health  programmes,  WHO  has  so far played  a rather  limited  role  in this  field; 
Alarmed  by the fact  that  there  are large  numbers  of working  populations  throughout  the world,  including 
workers  in agriculture,  transportation,  construction  work,  services  in small  industries,  and  office  work,  who 
are left  without  preventive  occupational  health  care  to control  their  various  health  problems; 
Emphasizing  the need  to improve  the present  knowledge  of the preventive  aspects  of occupational  health, 
particularly  where  new  industrial  technologies  are  being  introduced; 
1. URGES  Member  States  : 
(1) to  promote  and  carry  out  field  investigations  of the health  problems  of workers  in different  occupations  as a guide  for the planning  and  implementation  of comprehensive  health  programmes  for workers; 
(2) to  consider  the  health  of the  working  population  an integral  part  of public  health,  particularly 
when  developing  country  health  programmes  or establishing  new  industries; 
(3) in  developing  occupational  health  manpower,  to take  into  account  the  needs  of those  groups  of 
workers  to whom  health  services  are not available,  and  in such  circumstances  to utilize  health  personnel 
in industry  for carrying  out  comprehensive  health  care  services  for the working  population; 
(4) wherever  possible,  to undertake  monitoring  of the work  environment  and  workers'  health  with  a 
view  to instituting  control  measures  and  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of such  measures; 
(5) to  give  special  attention  to vulnerable  groups  of the  working  population  such  as young,  female, 
elderly  and  handicapped  workers,  workers  affected  by communicable  diseases  and  simultaneously  exposed 
to work  hazards,  migrant  workers,  miners,  and  transport  workers,  especially  seafarers; 
(6) to  report  annually  on occupational  diseases  and  sickness  absenteeism  within  the  framework  of 
health  statistics  in a standardized  health  reporting  system; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to  implement  the programme  in his report  and  to introduce  the new  elements  it contains  into  the 
medium-term  activities  of the Organization; 
(2) to  give  occupational  health  a high  priority  and  the  new  orientation  recommended  in his report, 
particularly  in areas  emphasizing  collaboration  with  countries  that  are  rapidly  being  industrialized  and 
in the development  of applied  research  in preventive  health  care  for workers  ； 
(3) to  assist  Member  States  in acquiring  systematic  information  on the health  problems  of the working 
population  and  in promoting  and  organizing  occupational  health  monitoring; 
(4) to  collaborate  with  countries  in developing  the  appropriate  services,  legislation  and  institutions 
concerned  with  workers'  health,  and  in intensifying  training  in occupational  health,  reporting  on progress 
of this  programme  to the Thirty-second  World  Health  Assembly; 
(5) to  maintain  close  coordination  with  the  International  Labour  Organisation  and  all other  international  agencies  and  regional  organizations  concerned  with  occupational  health  ； 
(6) to  account  for  this  development  in occupational  health  in the programme  of the Organization  in 
preparing  the  programme  budget  proposals  for  1978-79  and  to seek  and  encourage  extrabudgetary 
contributions  for  developing  this  programme; 
3. REQUESTS  the Regional  Committees  to discuss  in 1977  or 1978  the subject  of occupational  health,  with  A 
view  to active  implementation  of regional  programmes  of work  in occupational  health  at both  the 
country  and  intercountry  levels,  based  on the  needs  of each  country.
