The Twentieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  by the  Director-General  on control  measures  for  certain  dependenceproducing  drugs; 
Noting  with  great  concern  the  increasing  abuse  of certain  dependence-producing  psychotropic  drugs 
of the  sedative  and  stimulant  types  which  are  not  yet  under  international  control; 
Referring  to the recommendations  of the WHO  Expert  Committee  on Dependence-Producing  Drugs;3 
Recalling  the  conclusions  of the  United  Nations  Commission  on Narcotic  Drugs;4  and 
Realizing  the  immediate  need  of co-ordinated  national  measures  of control, 
1. URGES  Member  States  that  have  not  yet done  so to place  on medical  prescription,  without  delay,  those 
drugs  of the  sedative  and  stimulant  types  which  have  been  found  to be dependence-producing  and  have 
been  shown  to be abused,  and  to supervise  carefully  compliance  with  this  measure; 
2. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  States  provide,  in regard  to those  drugs,  for 
(i) supervision  of transactions  from  production  to retail  trade; 
(ii) licensing  of all producers; 
(iii) limitation  of trade  to authorized  persons; 
(iv) prohibition  of possession  without  authorization;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to continue  his consultations  with  the United  Nations  and  the Permanent 
Central  Narcotics  Board  on the  possibilities  of establishing  international  control  measures  for  the  drugs 
in question.
