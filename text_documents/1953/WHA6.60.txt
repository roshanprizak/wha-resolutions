WHA6.60  Technical  Discussions  at Future  Health  Assemblies 
The Sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  that  the technical  discussions  held  in the past  three  Health  Assemblies  have  contributed 
substantially  to the development  and  diffusion  of technical  knowledge  ; 
Considering  that  the  Health  Assemblies  present  a unique  opportunity  for  an informal  exchange  of 
views  between  public-health  administrators  from  all parts  of the world, 
REQUESTS  the Executive  Board,  at its twelfth  session, 
(1) to  study  the matter  of the organization  and  conduct  of technical  discussions  in the light  of the 
recommendations  made  by delegations  during  the current  Health  Assembly,  giving  special  attention 
to : 
(a) the  continuation  of the discussions  on an informal  basis, 
(b) the  possible  desirability  of the discussions'  being  introduced  by selected  experts, 
(c) the  limitation  of the discussions  to a single  subject  of particular  public-health  significance, 
and 
(id) the  limitation  of the discussions  to a total  period  not to exceed  the equivalent  of two  working 
days  ; 
(2) to  select  a subject  to be discussed  at the Seventh  World  Health  Assembly,  taking  into  account  the suggestions  made  by delegations  attending  the Sixth  World  Health  Assembly  ; and 
(3) to  instruct  the Director-General  to take  appropriate  action  to prepare  the technical  discussions 
at the Seventh  World  Health  Assembly  in accordance  with  the decision  of the Executive  Board.
