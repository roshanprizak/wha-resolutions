Agenda  item  19 13  May  1997 
Quality  of biological  products  moving 
in international  commerce 
The Fiftieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  the increasing  movement  across  international  boundaries  of vaccines  and other  biological  products 
for prevention  and/or  treatment  of diseases,  together  with  the rapid  development  and introduction  into  public 
health  programmes  of medicines  produced  by modern  biotechnology  in both  developed  and  developing 
countries; 
Recalling  previous  resolutions  of the Health  Assembly  mentioning  the vital  need  to ensure  the quality, 
safety  and efficacy  of both  established  and new  biological  products; 
Bearing  in mind  the responsibility  of governments  to ensure  that biological  products,  whether  imported 
or manufactured  locally,  are of good  quality; 
Recognizing  the specialized  technical  expertise  needed  for evaluating  and controlling  biological  products; 
Recalling  the role of WHO  in coordinating  technical  assistance,  including  assistance  given  on a bilateral 
and multilateral  basis,  and in promoting  resource  mobilization  from  various  sources,  and aware  that,  according 
to its Constitution  and the decisions  of previous  Health  Assemblies,  coordination  and  advocacy  are among 
WHO's  most  important  functions; 
Recognizing  that  WHO's  standardization  activities  need  strengthening  to meet  the challenges  of rapid 
growth  and expansion  in the field  of biologicals,  and also  evaluation  for any newly  observed  potential  impact 
such activities  may  have  on international  trade  as a result  of the entry  into  force  of World  Trade  Organization 
agreements; 
Recognizing  the long-standing  and valuable  role  of WHO's  biologicals  unit  and the Expert  Committee 
on Biological  Standardization; 
Recognizing  the report  and recommendations  of the ad hoc working  group  on the quality  of biological 
products  moving  in international  commerce  as reflected  in the Director-General's  report, 
1 • URGES  all Member  States: 
(1) to  use only  vaccines  and other  biological  products  of demonstrated  quality,  safety  and efficacy; 
WHA50.20 
(2) to  adopt,  as part of national  regulations,  requirements  published  by WHO  or equivalent  requirements 
of recognized  competent  control  authorities  to ensure  that  their  products  are safe,  effective  and of good 
quality; 
(3) to  strengthen  their  national  regulatory  authorities  and national  control  laboratories; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1 ) to  strengthen  the mechanism  for providing  clear  norms  and active  leadership  to promote  the quality, 
safety  and efficacy  of biological  and  biotechnological  products; 
(2) to  extend  the assistance  offered  to Member  States  within  the limits  of existing  resources  to develop 
and to strengthen  their  national  regulatory  authorities  and  control  laboratories  so as to increase  their 
competence  in this area,  efforts  to upgrade  the quality  of biological  products  being  focused  primarily  on 
increasing  the capabilities  of national  control  authorities; 
(3) to  revise  the approach  to the development  of requirements  and guidelines  for biologicals  to ensure 
that the documents  focus  primarily  on principles  and essential  elements  that ensure  the safety  and efficacy 
of products,  details  of specifications,  assays,  and processes  being  provided  as appendices,  as appropriate; 
(4) to  review  and update  existing  requirements  and  guidelines  for biologicals  and ensure  that  there  is 
a mechanism  to address  and resolve  rapidly  scientific  and medical  inconsistencies  in available  documents; 
(5) to  expand  WHO's  interaction  with  other  agencies  and  increase  the  use  of selected  WHO 
collaborating  centres  and other  organizations  in the preparation  and review  of documents  (including  draft 
guidelines  and requirements),  and  in the production  of International  Reference  Materials; 
(6) to  ensure  that the decisions  taken  by the WHO  Expert  Committee  on Biological  Standardization  are 
widely  disseminated  in a timely  manner; 
(7) to  keep  Member  States  informed  of the development  of new  biological  products  and their  potential 
value  and application; 
(8) to  serve  as the central  resource  for providing  guidance  on quality,  efficacy  and safety  of biological 
products,  when  requested  by a national  control  authority,  and  assist  in promoting  the exchange  of 
information  and "networking"  of authorities; 
(9) to  review  issues  of potential  conflict  of interest  and confidentiality  as they  relate  to the application 
of requirements  and  guidelines  published  by WHO,  including  advice  on the acceptability  of vaccines 
intended  for purchase  by other  organizations  of the United  Nations  system; 
(10) to convene  an independent  review  of WHO's  remit  and activities  in this field,  particularly  WHO's 
biologicals  unit,  covering  inter  alia how  it interacts  with  other  groups  with  related  functions  within  WHO 
and externally,  with  a view  to recommending  action  that will assist  in the harmonization  of standards  and 
requirements,  minimize  duplication  of activities  and enable  WHO  to respond  to scientific  developments
