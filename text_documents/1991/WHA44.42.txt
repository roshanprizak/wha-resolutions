socioeconomic  and political  status,  for equal recognition  and remuneration  of women for 
work of equal value, and for their full participation  in health and development;

Recognizing  that women make an essential  contribution  to the socioeconomic 
development  of countries  while not always enjoying  the full benefits  of this process；

during the Forty-fifth  World Health Assembly  in 1992, and in preparation  for these
