FORTY-NINTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA49.10 
Agenda  item  18.1  25  May  1996 
Smallpox  eradication  - destruction  of 
variola  virus  stocks 
The Forty-ninth  World Health Assembly, 
Noting that on 8 May 1980 the Thirty-third  World Health Assembly  in resolution  WHA33.3  declared 
the global eradication  of smallpox; 
Noting further that resolution  WHA33.4  endorsed  recommendations  for the post-eradication  era which 
specified that remaining  stocks of variola virus should be held at only a limited number of sites, and that the 
stock of variola virus has since been reduced and restricted  to the WHO collaborating  centre on smallpox  and 
other poxvirus  infections  designated  at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  Atlanta, Georgia, 
USA, and the Russian State Research  Centre of Virology  and Biotechnology,  Koltsovo,  Novosibirsk  Region, 
Russian Federation; 
Recognizing  that sequence  information  on the genome of several variola virus strains and the cloned 
DNA fragments  of genome of variola virus allow scientific  questions  about the properties  of the viral genes 
and proteins to be solved as well as any problem with diagnosis  of suspected  smallpox,  and that the escape 
of variola virus from laboratories  would be a serious risk as an increasing  proportion  of the population  lack 
immunity  to smallpox, 
RECOMMENDS  that the remaining  stocks of variola virus, including  all whitepox  viruses,  viral 
genomic DNA, clinical specimens  and other material containing  infectious  variola virus, should be destroyed 
on 30 June 1999 after a decision has been taken by the Health Assembly,  that being a moratorium  of fiveand-a-half  years from the deadline of 31 December  1993 proposed  by the ad hoc committee  on orthopoxvirus 
infections,  with a view to taking action to achieve a broader consensus.
