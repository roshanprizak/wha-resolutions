The Twenty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  received  information  concerning  the  increasing  misuse,  especially  by young  people,  of central 
nervous  system  stimulants  of the  amphetamine  type; 
Considering  the  special  problems  of abuse  of such  stimulants,  as reported  by certain  Member  States; 
Deeply  concerned  at the continuing  and  spreading  problem  posed  by the abuse  of psychotropic  substances 
not under  international  control; 
Recognizing  the  responsibilities  of the  World  Health  Organization  and  other  competent  organs  within 
the framework  of the  United  Nations  in combating  the  very  serious  problems  of drug  abuse; 
Recalling  the  resolutions  adopted  by the  Eighteenth  and  Twentieth  World  Health  Assemblies  relating 
to control  measures  for  psychotropic  drugs; 
Reiterating  the  high  importance  it attaches  to the  adoption  and  strict  application  by Member  States 
of the  measures  of national  control  recommended  in the  aforementioned  resolutions;  and 
Recognizing  the  need  for  urgent  consideration  of measures  of international  control  of psychotropic 
substances, 
1. NOTES  that  the Secretary-General  of the United  Nations,  at the request  of the United  Nations  Commission 
on Narcotic  Drugs,  has  circulated  to governments  a questionnaire  seeking  information  on existing  control 
measures  and  on the  need  for,  and  nature  of, national  and  international  controls  for psychotropic  substances; 
2. NOTES  further  that  replies  from  governments  to the  aforementioned  questionnaire  must  reach  the 
Secretary-General  by 15 June  1968,  so as to enable  the  United  Nations  Commission  on Narcotic  Drugs  to 
proceed  without  delay  to the  completion  of a draft  of an international  instrument  for  control  of psychotropic 
substances; 
3. NOTES  also  that  the  Director-General  of the  World  Health  Organization  is prepared  to  advise  the 
Secretary-General  of the  United  Nations  in the  elaboration  of such  a draft  international  instrument,  and  in 
the identification  of drugs  that  would  be controlled  thereunder; 
4. WELCOMES  the action  which  the  Commission  on Narcotic  Drugs  is already  taking  and  expresses  the  hope 
that the  Commission  will  propose  effective  measures  of international  control  of psychotropic  substances 
at its next  session; 
5. EXPRESSES  the  view  that  agreement  should  be reached  as quickly  as possible  on effective  international 
control  provisions;  and 
6. URGES  Member  States  to adopt  the  national  controls  earlier  recommended  by  the  Twentieth  World 
Health  Assembly,  in resolution  WHA20.43,  and  currently  under  discussion  in the  Economic  and  Social 
Council,  pending  the  development  and  implementation  of any  necessary  international  instruments.
