WHO  ETHICAL  CRITERIA  FOR  MEDICINAL  DRUG 
PROMOTION 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA41.17  and WHA43.20; 
Having  considered  the report  on the use of the WHO  ethical  criteria  for medicinal  drug  promotion; 
Noting  with concern  that little  information  is available  on any progress  in controlling  medicinal  drug 
promotion  through  the use of the concepts  embodied  in the WHO  ethical  criteria; 
Noting  that many  drug regulatory  authorities  do not yet have  the administrative  resources  to regulate 
drug promotion; 
Mindful  that a high level  of compliance  and self-regulation  by the pharmaceutical  industry  is necessary, 
1. URGES  Member  States  to intensify  efforts  to involve  government  agencies  including  drug  regulatory 
authorities,  as well as pharmaceutical  manufacturers,  distributors  and the promotion  industry,  health  personnel 
involved  in the prescription,  dispensing,  supply  and distribution  of drugs,  universities  and other  teaching 
institutions，professional  associations,  patient  and consumer  groups,  and the professional  and general  media 
(including  publishers  and editors  of medical  journals  and related  publications),  in the implementation  of the 
principles  embodied  in the WHO  ethical  criteria  on medicinal  drug  promotion; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to request  the Council  for International  Organizations  of Medical  Sciences  (CIOMS)  to convene  a 
meeting  of interested  parties  in collaboration  with WHO  to discuss  possible  approaches  to further 
advancing  the principles  embodied  in WHO's  ethical  criteria  for medicinal  drug  promotion; 
(2) to consider  other  approaches  and mechanisms  in the Member  States  to improve  the 
implementation  of WHO's  ethical  criteria  for medicinal  drug  promotion; 
(3) to report  the outcome  of the meeting  of interested  parties  and other  actions  of the Organization 
relevant  to this issue  to the Forty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly  through  the Executive  Board.
