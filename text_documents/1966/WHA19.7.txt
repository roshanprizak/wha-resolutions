WHA19.7  Establishment  of a Revolving  Fund  for  Teaching  and  Laboratory  Equipment  for  Medical  Education 
and Training 
The Nineteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  that  trained  manpower  is of fundamental  importance  for  health  programmes,  and  realizing 
that the  shortage  of teaching  and  laboratory  equipment  in medical  and  paramedical  schools  is a great 
handicap  in imparting  medical  education,  especially  in the  developing  countries; 
Having  considered  the  recommendations  of the  Executive  Board  to establish  a revolving  fund  to 
finance,  on  a reimbursement  basis,  the  purchase  of teaching  and  laboratory  equipment  for  medical  and 
paramedical  education  and  training;  and 
Considering  that  the  establishment  of such  a revolving  fund  would  provide  valuable  assistance  to 
Members, 
1. DECIDES  to establish  a revolving  fund  to finance,  on  a reimbursable  basis,  without  service  charge, 
requests  from  governments  to purchase  teaching  and  laboratory  equipment  for  medical  and  paramedical 
education  and  training; 
2. AUTHORIZES  the  Director-General  to accept  in reimbursement  for  such  purchases  the  national  currency 
of the  Member  concerned  subject  to the  following  provisions: 
(1) that  the  full  estimated  cost  of the  requested  purchase  and  shipping  costs  be deposited  with  the 
Organization  in advance;  and 
(2) that  the  total  expenditure  for  any  one  Member  for  any  one  request  be I imited  to 10 per  cent,  of 
the usable  balance  of the  fund  at the  time  the  request  is received; 
3. AUTHORIZES  the  Director-General  to exchange  the  various  currencies  accumulated  in the  fund  for 
convertible  currencies  available  in the  regular  budget,  provided  the  Organization  can  make  use  of such 
currencies  in its programmes; 
4. DECIDES  to include  an amount  of $100  000  in the  supplementary  estimates  for  1966  as the  first  of five 
instalments  to commence  operation  of the  fund; 
5. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to include  similar  amounts  for  the  same  purpose  in the  budgets  for 
the years  1968  to 1971;  and 
6. REQUESTS  the  Executive  Board  and  the  Director-General  to review  and  consider  the  policies  and 
conditions  governing  the  operation  of the  fund  at least  once  every  five  years;  however,  special  review  or 
consideration  may  be requested  by either  at any  time  deemed  necessary.
