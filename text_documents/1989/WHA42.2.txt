Aware that worldwide  economic  trends  have seriously  hampered  the efforts  of many 
Member States  to reduce  social  inequities  and, in some situations,  have worsened  the 
plight of the poor;

health-for-all  strategies  in order to achieve  the goals and targets  set by Member  States 
for the year 2000;
