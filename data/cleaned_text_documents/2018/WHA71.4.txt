The Seventy-first World Health Assembly, Recalling resolution WHA64.15 (2011) on cholera: mechanism for control and prevention, which led to the revitalization of the Global Task Force on Cholera Control to support Member States to reduce the public health, social and economic consequences of cholera by strengthening WHOs work in this area, and improving collaboration and coordination among stakeholders; Recognizing the report by the Director-General on WHOs work in health emergencies1 and the Global Task Force on Cholera Controls recently launched strategy, Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030 large-scale outbreaks of cholera continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality among vulnerable populations in both emergency and endemic settings. With an estimated disease burden of 2.9 million cases and 95 000 deaths every year worldwide, the disease still affects at least 47 countries around the globe, with a potential to spread where water, sanitation and hygiene conditions are inadequate; Acknowledging that the prevention and control of cholera require a coordinated and multisectoral approach that includes access to appropriate health care, early case management, access to safe water, sanitation, education, health literacy and improved hygiene behaviours, with adjunct use of oral cholera vaccines, strengthened surveillance and information sharing, strengthened laboratory capacity and community involvement, including action on the social determinants of health; Acknowledging also that cholera control is both a matter of emergency response in the case of outbreaks, anda matter of development when the disease is endemic in high-risk contexts, such as in camps for refugees and internally displaced people; Affirming that progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development including commitment to Goal 3 (Ensure healthy li ves and promote well-being for all at all ages); Goal 6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all); and Goal 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable), would reduce the prevalence and spread of cholera, along with other diarrhoeal diseases and enteric infections; Recalling that all States Parties must comply with the International Health Regulations (2005); Acknowledging that cholera, as a disease of epidemic potential, has tobe recognized in itself and reported separately from other diarrhoeal diseases, within national surveillance systems, as not doing so hampers effective control measures, 1 Document A71 / 6. 2 Ending cholera : a global roadmap to 2030-roadmap.pdf?ua=1 , accessed 21 May 2018).
