The Twentieth World Health Assembly, Having noted the report of the Director-General; Having heard the statements of the Director-General concerning the future general programme developments of the Organization and the trends of increase in costs of the services provided by the Organization; Recognizing that the annual increase in costs of the Organization for maintaining the activities at the same level as the preceding year requires an increase in each effective working budget of between 4 and 5 per cent.; Noting that resources being provided for health services under the Technical Assistance component of the United Nations Development Programme have not been increased inaccordance with the urgent requirements of the world health situation in recent years, but that, on the contrary, they have been decreased; Desirous of making available sufficient funds to allow for an orderly increase in the services tobe provided by the Organization to its Members, and particularly to the developing countries, in the gradual achievement of the Organization's objective under Article I of the Constitution; and Conscious of the provisions of Articles 34 and 55 of the Constitution, 1. RECOMMENDS to the Director-General that as a general orientation in preparing his proposed programme and budget estimates for 1969 he should, taking account of the views expressed by delegations during the discussions at the Twentieth World Health Assembly, propose an increase in the programme such as will give a budget increase of an order of magnitude of about 9 per cent., provided that no unusual and unforeseen developments occur which would result in additional resources being required by the Organization; and 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to convey to Member States the emphatic view of the Twentieth World Health Assembly that greater priority for health programmes in applications for technical assistance under the United Nations Development Programme is justified.
