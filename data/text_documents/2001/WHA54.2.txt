FIFTY-FOURTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA54.2
Agenda item 13.1 18 May 2001
Infant and young child nutrition
The Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly,
Recalling resolutions WHA33.32, WHA34.22, WHA35.26, WHA37.30, WHA39.28,
WHA41.11, WHA43.3, WHA45.34, WHA46.7, WHA47.5 and WHA49.15 on infant and young childnutrition, appropriate feeding practices and related questions;
Deeply concerned to improve infant and young child nutrition and to alleviate all forms of
malnutrition in the world, because more than one-third of under-five children are still malnourished –
whether stunted, wasted, or deficient in iodine, vitamin A, iron or other micronutrients – and becausemalnutrition still contributes to nearly half of the 10.5 million deaths each year among preschoolchildren worldwide;
Deeply alarmed that malnutrition of infants and young children remains one of the most severe
global public health problems, at once a major cause and consequence of poverty, deprivation, foodinsecurity and social inequality, and that malnutrition is a cause not only of increased vulnerability to
infection and other diseases, including growth retardation, but also of intellectual, mental, social and
developmental handicap, and of increased risk of disease throughout childhood, adolescence and adultlife;
Recognizing the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the
right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, and that every
effort should be made with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of this right;
Acknowledging the need for all sectors of society – including governments, civil society, health
professional associations, nongovernmental organizations, commercial enterprises and international
bodies – to contribute to improved nutrition for infants and young children by using every possible
means at their disposal, especially by fostering optimal feeding practices, incorporating acomprehensive multisectoral, holistic and strategic approach;
Noting the guidance of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 24,
which recognizes, inter alia , the need for access to and availability of both support and information
concerning the use of basic knowledge of child health and nutrition, and the advantages ofbreastfeeding for all segments of society, in particular parents and children;
Conscious that despite the fact that the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk
Substitutes and relevant, subsequent Health Assembly resolutions state that there should be no
advertising or other forms of promotion of products within its scope, new modern communicationmethods, including electronic means, are currently increasingly being used to promote such products;WHA54.2
2and conscious of the need for the Codex Alimentarius Commission to take the International Code and
subsequent relevant Health Assembly resolutions into consideration in dealing with health claims inthe development of food standards and guidelines;
Mindful that 2001 marks the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the International Code of
Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, and that the adoption of the present resolution provides an
opportunity to reinforce the International Code ’s fundamental role in protecting, promoting and
supporting breastfeeding;
Recognizing that there is a sound scientific basis for policy decisions to reinforce activities of
Member States and those of WHO; for proposing new and innovative approaches to monitoring
growth and improving nutrition; for promoting improved breastfeeding and complementary feedingpractices, and sound culture-specific counselling; for improving the nutritional status of women of
reproductive age, especially during and after pregnancy; for alleviating all forms of malnutrition; and
for providing guidance on feeding practices for infants of mothers who are HIV-positive;
Noting the need for effective systems for assessing the magnitude and geographical distribution
of all forms of malnutrition, together with their consequences and contributing factors, and offoodborne diseases; and for monitoring food security;
Welcoming the efforts made by WHO, in close collaboration with UNICEF and other
international partners, to develop a comprehensive global strategy for infant and young child feeding,
and to use the ACC Sub-Committee on Nutrition as an interagency forum for coordination andexchange of information in this connection,
1. THANKS the Director-General for the progress report on the development of a new global
strategy for infant and young child feeding;
2. URGES Member States:
(1) to recognize the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent
with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger,
and that every effort should be made with a view to achieving progressively the full realization
of this right and to call on all sectors of society to cooperate in efforts to improve the nutrition
of infants and young children;
(2) to take necessary measures as States Parties effectively to implement the Convention on
the Rights of the Child, in order to ensure every child ’s right to the highest attainable standard
of health and health care;
(3) to set up or strengthen interinstitutional and intersectoral discussion forums with all
stakeholders in order to reach national consensus on strategies and policies including
reinforcing, in collaboration with ILO, policies that support breastfeeding by working women,in order substantially to improve infant and young child feeding and to develop participatory
mechanisms for establishing and implementing specific nutrition programmes and projects
aimed at new initiatives and innovative approaches;
(4) to strengthen activities and develop new approaches to protect, promote and support
exclusive breastfeeding for six months as a global public health recommendation, taking into
account the findings of the WHO expert consultation on optimal duration of exclusiveWHA54.2
3breastfeeding,1 and to provide safe and appropriate complementary foods, with continued
breastfeeding for up to two years of age or beyond, emphasizing channels of socialdissemination of these concepts in order to lead communities to adhere to these practices;
(5) to support the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative and to create mechanisms, including
regulations, legislation or other measures, designed, directly and indirectly, to support periodic
reassessment of hospitals, and to ensure maintenance of standards and the Initiative ’s long-term
sustainability and credibility;
(6) to improve complementary foods and feeding practices by ensuring sound and culturespecific nutrition counselling to mothers of young children, recommending the widest possible
use of indigenous nutrient-rich foodstuffs; and to give priority to the development anddissemination of guidelines on nutrition of children under two years of age, to the training of
health workers and community leaders on this subject, and to the integration of these messages
into strategies for health and nutrition information, education and communication;
(7) to strengthen monitoring of growth and improvement of nutrition, focusing on
community-based strategies, and to strive to ensure that all malnourished children, whether in acommunity or hospital setting, are correctly diagnosed and treated;
(8) to develop, implement or strengthen sustainable measures including, where appropriate,
legislative measures, aimed at reducing all forms of malnutrition in young children and women
of reproductive age, especially iron, vitamin A and iodine deficiencies, through a combination
of strategies that include supplementation, food fortification and diet diversification, through
recommended feeding practices that are culture-specific and based on local foods, as well asthrough other community-based approaches;
(9) to strengthen national mechanisms to ensure global compliance with the International
Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and subsequent relevant Health Assembly
resolutions, with regard to labelling as well as all forms of advertising, and commercialpromotion in all types of media, to encourage the Codex Alimentarius Commission to take the
International Code and relevant subsequent Health Assembly resolutions into consideration in
developing its standards and guidelines; and to inform the general public on progress inimplementing the Code and subsequent relevant Health Assembly resolutions;
