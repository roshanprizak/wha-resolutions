Roll Back Malaria
The Fifty-second World Health Assembly,
Having considered the report of the Director-General on Roll Back Malaria;
Concerned that the  global burden of malaria is a challenge to human development and a significant cause
of poverty and human suffering, particularly in the poorest nations of the world;
Mindful of the efficacious tools currently available to reduce this burden, and the potential for their more
effective use within malaria-affected communities;
Welcoming  the decision by the Director-General to establish a Cabinet project to support rolling bac k
malaria which works across the Organization;
Noting that Roll Back Malaria represents a new approach promoted by WHO, in which all concerne d
parties are encouraged to work in a coordinated partnership, united by common goals, consistent strategies and
agreed methods of working, and that R oll Back Malaria is serving as a pathfinder in bringing these concepts into
operation in relation to other international health issues;
Commending the key features of the new appro ach, namely, increased focus on the needs of people at risk,
better response to those needs w ith evidence-based action, greater use of existing tools, their full integration into
the health sector as a horizontal prog ramme, and innovative public-private partnerships to develop cost-effective
products and tools in view of the emergence of drug and insecticide resistance;
