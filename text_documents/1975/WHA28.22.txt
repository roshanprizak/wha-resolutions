Executive  Board 
The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  the entry  into  force  of the amendments  to Articles  24 and  25 of the Constitution,  increasing 
the membership  of the Executive  Board  from  24 to 30; 
Considering  that  the equitable  geographical  distribution  of seats  on the Executive  Board  would  be facilitated  by a further  increase  in its membership, 
REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to propose  for  the  consideration  of the  Twenty-ninth  World  Health 
Assembly  draft  amendments  to the Constitution  in order  to permit  a further  marginal  increase,  so that  each 
region  could  designate  at least  one  new  member  to the  Executive  Board  each  year,  and  to transmit  such 
draft  amendments  to Members  at least  six months  in advance  of their  consideration  in accordance  with  the 
provision  of Article  73 of the Constitution.
