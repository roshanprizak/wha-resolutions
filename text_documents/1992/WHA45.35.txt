Agenda  item  33 
GLOBAL  STRATEGY  FOR  THE  PREVENTION 
AND  CONTROL  OF AIDS 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on the global  strategy  for the prevention  and 
control  of AIDS;  “ 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA40.26,  WHA41.24,  WHA42.33,  WHA42.34  and  WHA43.10,  as well  as United 
Nations  General  Assembly  resolution  46/203; 
Acknowledging  the leading  role  of WHO  in the guidance  and  coordination  of AIDS  control,  prevention, 
care,  research  activities  and  support  to those  who  are ill and  their  families; 
Expressing  appreciation  to all organizations  and  bodies  of the United  Nations  system,  and  the many 
nongovernmental  organizations  concerned,  for their  active  collaboration  in support  of the global  AIDS  strategy; 
Recognizing  with  concern  that  the pandemic  is spreading  rapidly  in developing  countries  and  continuing 
to increase  in urban  areas  of some  industrialized  countries,  especially  in populations  with  high  rates  of injecting 
drug  use and  sexually  transmitted  diseases;  that  heterosexual  transmission  is increasing  throughout  the world 
which  means  an increasing  number  of infected  women  and  children;  that  an increasing  burden  is being  placed 
on already  strained  health  services;  and  that  a multisectoral  response  is required  to reduce  the further  spread 
of human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  infection  and  AIDS  and  to mitigate  the social  and  economic 
consequences  of the pandemic; 
Recognizing  that  there  is no public  health  rationale  for any  measures  that  limit  the rights  of the 
individual,  notably  measures  establishing  mandatory  screening; 
Recognizing  the importance  of decentralization  of the implementation  of the global  AIDS  strategy  from 
the national  to the district  and  community  level, 
1. ENDORSES  the  updated  global  AIDS  strategy,  proposing  the following  essential  ways  to meet  the new 
challenges  of the evolving  pandemic;  better  prevention  and  treatment  programmes  for other  sexually 
transmitted  diseases;  greater  focus  on prevention  of HIV  infection  through  improvement  of women's  health， 
education  and  status;  a social  environment  giving  more  support  to prevention  programmes;  greater  emphasis 
on the public  health  dangers  of stigmatization  of people  known  to be or suspected  of being  infected,  and  of 
discrimination  against  them;  and  increasing  emphasis  on care; 
2. CALLS  UPON  Member  States: 
(1) to  intensify  national  AIDS  prevention  efforts,  with  commitment  and  leadership  at the highest 
political  level; WHA45.35

(5) to  mobilize  national  resources  and  ensure  a multisectoral  response  to the pandemic,  including

and economic  consequences,  by involving  all sectors  of government  and  key elements  in society  such  as 
community  groups  and  religious  and  other  community  leaders; 
(6) to  reinforce  efforts  to oppose  discrimination  against  persons  and  specific  groups  known  to be or

to HIV/AIDS  and  that  public  health  is not undermined  by discrimination  and  stigmatization;

urgent  and  intensive  action  against  HIV/AIDS; 
(8) to  stress  the importance  of educating  health  professionals,  especially  nurses  and  midwives,  and 
provide  counselling  and  support  services  to those  who  give  care  to AIDS  patients;

conformity  with  the updated  global  AIDS  strategy  and  to mobilize  human,  financial  and  moral  resources; 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to  advocate  vigorously  the commitment  of decision-makers  to developing  action-oriented 
programmes  and  mobilizing  the national  and  international  resources  required  to sustain  efforts  for 
prevention,  care,  research  and  support  activities  to reduce  socioeconomic  impact; 
(2) to  ensure  that  the updated  global  AIDS  strategy  is effectively  supported  and  implemented  at all
