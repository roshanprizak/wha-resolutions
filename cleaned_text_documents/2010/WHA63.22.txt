The Sixty-third World Health Assembly, Having considered the report on human organ and tissue transplantation;1 Recalling resolutions WHA40.13, WHA42.5 and WHA44.25 on organ procurement and transplantation and WHA57.18 requesting an update of the Guiding Principles on Human Organ Transplantation; Aware of the growing magnitude and utility of human cell, tissue and organ transplantation awide range of conditions in low-resource aswell as high-resource countries; Committed to the principles of human dignity and solidarity which condemn the buying of human body parts for transplantation and exploitation of the poorest and most vulnerable populations and the human trafficking that result from such practices; Determined to prevent harm cause d by the seeking of financial gain or comparable advantage in transactions involving human body parts, including organ trafficking and transplant tourism; Convinced that the voluntary, non-remunera ted donation of organs, cells and tissues from deceased and living donors helps to ensure avital community resource; Conscious of the extensive cross-boundary circulation of cells and tissues for transplantation; Sensitive to the need for post-transplantation surveillance of adverse events and reactions associated with the donation, including long-ter m follow up of the living donor, processing and transplantation of human cells, tissues and organs as such and for international exchange of such data to optimize the safety and efficacy of transplantation, 1. ENDORSES the WHO Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation; 1 Document A63 / 24. WHA63.22 2 2. URGES Member States:1 (1) to implement the Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation in the formulation and enforcement of their own po licies, laws and legislation regarding human cell, tissue and organ donation and transplantation where appropriate; (2) to promote the development of systems for the altruistic voluntary non-remunerated donation of cells, tissues and organs as such, and increase public awareness and understanding of the benefits as a result of the voluntary non-remunerated provision of cells, tissues and organs as such from deceased and living donors, in contrast to the physical, psychological and social risks to individuals and communities caused by trafficking in material of human origin and transplant tourism; (3) to oppose the seeking of financial gain or comparable advantage in transactions involving human body parts, organ trafficking and transplant tourism, including by encouraging healthcare professionals to notify relevant authorities when they become aware of such practices inaccordance with national capacities and legislation; (4) to promote a system of transparent, equitable allocation of organs, cells and tissues, guided by clinical criteria and ethical norms, aswell as equitable access to transplantation services inaccordance with national capacities, which provides the foundation for public support of voluntary donation; (5) to improve the safety and efficacy of donation and transplantation by promoting international best practices; (6) to strengthen national and multinational aut horities and / or capacities to provide oversight, organization and coordination of donation and transplantation activ ities, with special attention to maximizing donation from deceased donors and to protecting the health and welfare of living donors with appropriate health-care services and long-term follow up; (7) to collaborate in collecting data including adverse events and reac tions on the practices, safety, quality, efficacy, epidemiology and ethics of donation and transplantation; (8) to encourage the implementation of globally consistent coding systems for human cells, tissues and organs as such in order to facilitate national and international traceability of materials of human origin for transplantation; 3. REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to disseminate the updated Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation as widely as possible to all interested parties; (2) to provide support to Member States and nongovernmental organizations in order to ban trafficking in material of human origin and transplant tourism; (3) to continue collecting and analysing global data on the practices, safety, quality, efficacy, epidemiology and ethics of donation and transplantation of human cells , tissues and organs; 1 And regional economic international organizations where appropriate.
