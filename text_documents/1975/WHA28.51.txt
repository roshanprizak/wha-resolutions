The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Drawing  the attention  of Member  States  once  more  to one  of the most  urgent  public  health  problems 
in the developing  countries  today—the  tropical  parasitic  diseases,  and  particularly  onchocerciasis,  filariasis, 
schistosomiasis  and  trypanosomiasis,  which  cause  great  damage  to the people's  health  and  retard  social  and 
economic  progress  in most  of the developing  countries  ； 
Noting  the  steps  taken  by the  Organization  in accordance  with  resolution  WHA27.52  to intensify 
research  programmes  on tropical  parasitic  diseases,  as described  in the  Director-General's  report  on the 
work  of WHO  in 1974;1 
Considering  it necessary  to give  priority  attention  to the development  of recommendations  and  methods 
for these  programmes  for the control  of the most  important  tropical  parasitic  diseases  and  primarily  the 
programmes  for the control  of onchocerciasis,  schistosomiasis,  etc.,  which  are being  already  carried  out  or 
are at the active  planning  stage,  using  to this  end  all the experience  accumulated  by the Member  States  ； 
Welcoming  the WHO  biomedical  research  effort  in this  field, 
1. URGES  Member  States,  research  and  practical  establishments  and  medical  scientists  working  on aspects 
of tropical  pathology  to intensify  their  efforts  to develop  effective,  safe  and  practicable  means  of controlling 
tropical  parasitic  diseases  ； and 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to undertake  the measures  needed  to improve  the system  of coordinating 
the various  programmes  for the control  of the tropical  parasitic  diseases  and  also  the methods  of carrying 
out these  programmes  and  to pay  special  attention  to these  aspects  in the report  he is to make  to the Twentyninth  World  Health  Assembly  under  the terms  of resolution  WHA27.52.
