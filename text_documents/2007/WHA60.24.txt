the outcomes of the six international conferences on health promotion (Ottawa, 1986; Adelaide, 
Australia, 1988; Sundsvall, Sweden, 1991; Jakarta, 1997; Mexico City, 2000;  Bangkok, 2005); 
Having considered the report on follow-up to the 6th Global Conference on Health Promotion 
(Bangkok in 2005),1 which confirms the need to focus on health promotion actions to address the 
determinants of health; 
Drawing on the Declaration of Alma-Ata, the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, and the 
Bangkok Charter for Health Promotion in a Globalized World which sets out strategic directions for 
equitable health improvement in the first decades of the twenty-first century; 
Considering the actions and recommendations set out in the Bangkok Charter for Health 
Promotion in a Globalized World to make the promotion of health central to the global development agenda, a core responsibility for all governments and  a key focus of communities, civil society, and 
the private sector;  
Noting that health promotion is essential for meeting the targets of the internationally agreed 
health-related development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, is intimately related to the work of WHOâ€™s Commission on Social Determinants of Health, and makes an 
important contribution to realizing the objectives of the Eleventh General Programme of Work; 
Recognizing that the dramatic changes of the global burden of disease, notably due to 
noncommunicable diseases, require greater attention, and call for adjustments in society at large and in 
resource allocation in order to tackle the immediate and underlying determinants of health; 
Recognizing that health promotion contributes to the achievement of health for all;  
Confirming the importance of addressing also the wider determinants of health, and of 
implementing recommendations on, and undertaking action for, health for all,
