WHA20.50  Policy  governing  Assistance  to the Developing  Countries 
The Twentieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that  the  essential  objective  of the  Organization  is the attainment  by all peoples  of the 
highest  possible  level  of health; 
Considering  the ever  greater  disparity  that  is developing  in health  programmes  as between  the developed 
and the  newly  independent  countries; 
Being  of the  opinion  that,  for  the  attainment  of the objective  of the Organization,  harmonization  is 
required  in the implementation  of its programmes; 
Considering  that  the  Organization's  assistance  is provided  mainly  in the  form  of technical  personnel 
and of aid to research  and  training;  and 
Realizing  that,  for the implementation  of their  national  programmes,  the requirements  of some  of the 
developing  countries  exceed  their  resources, 
1. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to study  the measures  which  could  be taken  to assist  developing  countries, 
with  particular  reference  to the means  by which,  within  the limits  of the budget  and  making  the best  use  of 
all other  available  resources: 
(1) material  assistance  to the programmes  of those  countries  could  be increased; 
(2) the  organizational  resources  available  to States  for the execution  of their  programmes  could  be 
supplemented  to the  fullest  possible  extent;  and 
(3) further  assistance  to the operating  expenses  of priority  national  or regional  programmes  could  be 
obtained  ; 
2. FURTHER  REQUESTS  the Director-General  to report  on this  subject  to the forty-first  session  of the Executive 
Board  and  the Twenty-first  World  Health  Assembly;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  to review  the matter  in the light  of the discussions  at the Twentieth  World 
Health  Assembly  and  the Director-General's  report,  and  to report  thereon  to the Twenty-first  World  Health 
Assembly.
