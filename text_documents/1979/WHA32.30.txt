the Declaration of Alma-Ata,  which :
(1) states that primary health care,  forming as it does an integral part both of

of overall social and economic development,  is the key to attaining an acceptable 
level of health for all ;

plans of action to launch and sustain primary health care as part of a comprehensive 
national health system and in coordination with other sectors ;

implement primary health care throughout the world,  and particularly in developing

International Economic Order ;

encourage and support national strategies and plans for primary health care as part 
of overall development,  and should also formulate as soon as possible appropriate 
plans of action at the regional and global levels to promote and facilitate the 
mutual support of countries for accelerated development of primary health care ;
