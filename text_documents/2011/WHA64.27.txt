Agenda item 13.14 24 May 2011 
Child injury prevention 
 
The Sixty-fourth World Health Assembly, 
Recalling resolution WHA57.10 on road safety a nd health, which affirmed that road traffic 
injuries constitute a major public health problem th at required coordinated international efforts; 
Recalling also that the Health Assembly in reso lution WHA57.10 accepted the invitation by the 
United Nations General Assembly for WHO to act as a coordinator on road safety issues within the 
United Nations system, working in close collabora tion with the United Nations regional commissions; 
Further recalling resolution WHA60.22 on hea lth systems: emergency-care systems, which 
recognized that improved organizati on and planning for provision of tr auma and emergency care is an 
essential part of integrated health-care delivery,  and resolution WHA58.23 on disability, including 
prevention, management and rehabilitation, which ur ged Member States to take all necessary steps for 
the reduction of risk factors contributing to disabilities in childhood; 
Acknowledging the responsibilities to ensure safet y in the care and protection of children 
affirmed in the Convention on the Rights of the Ch ild (1989), in the International Labour Organization 
Convention 182 (1999) and in the International Labo ur Organization Convention 138 (1973), and further 
acknowledging the responsibilities to protect persons with disabilities set out in the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) particul arly in developing, low- and middle-income 
countries where there exists a significant burden of child injuries; 
Recognizing that child injuries are a major threat to child survival and health, that they are a 
neglected public health problem with significant consequences in terms of mortality, morbidity, 
quality of life, social and economic costs, and that in the absence of urgent action this problem will hamper attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in developing, low- and 
middle-income countries, where there exists  a significant burden of child injuries; 
Recognizing that the leading causes of child death from unintentional injury include road traffic 
injury, drowning, fire-related burns , falls and poisoning. In some re gions of the world, drowning is 
responsible for about half of total child injury deaths; context-specific preventive measures including 
safe environment, safety products, safety mana gement and awareness raising are crucial; 
Further recognizing that multisectoral approach es to preventing child injuries and limiting their 
consequences through implementation of evidence-b ased interventions have resulted in dramatic and 
sustained reductions in child injury in c ountries that have made concerted efforts; WHA64.27 
 
 
  
 
 
2 Welcoming the joint WHO/UNICEF World report on child injury prevention1 and its 
recommendations for public health policy and programming; 
Considering that existing programmes on child survival and child health and development 
should introduce child injury prevention strategies, en suring these are an integrated part of child health 
services, and that the success of child health progr ammes should not only be gauged by the use of 
traditional measures of infectious disease mortality bu t also by indicators of fatal and non-fatal injury, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to prioritize the prevention of child injury among child issues and ensure that intersectoral 
coordination mechanisms necessary to prevent ch ild injury are established or strengthened; 
(2) to  continue and, if necessary, to strengthen th e fulfilment of their obligations under the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of children 
to the highest attainable standard of health and to take all appropriate legislative, administrative, 
social and educational measures to protect children from injury; 
(3) to ensure that funding mechanisms for relevant programmes, including health 
programmes, cover child injury and prevention,  emergency care, pre-hospital care, treatment 
and rehabilitation services; 
(4) to implement, as appropriate, the recommendations of the WHO/UNICEF World report 
on child injury prevention , including, if not already in place, the assignation of a leadership role 
to a government agency or unit for child inju ry prevention and the appointment of a focal 
person for injury prevention, ensuring that su ch leadership facilitates collaboration between 
relevant sectors of government, communities and ci vil society; and, according to national needs, 
the key strategies identified in the World report  as effective interventions for preventing child 
injury; and to monitor and evaluate the impact of these interventions; 
(5) to integrate child injury prevention in national child developm ent programmes and in 
other relevant programmes, and to establis h multisectoral coordination and collaboration 
mechanisms, in particular ensuring that preven tion of child injury is accorded appropriate 
importance within programmes fo r child survival and health; 
(6) to ensure that national data collection across relevant sectors or surveillance systems 
quantifies the demographic, socioeconomic and ep idemiological profile of the burden of, risk 
factors for, and costs of child injury, and to assure  that the resources available are 
commensurate with the extent of the problem; 
(7) to develop and implement a multisectoral polic y and plan of action, where necessary, that 
contain realistic targets for child injury prev ention and include promotion of standards and 
codes on the prevention of child labour, as well as on legal adolescent employment, product 
safety, school and play spaces, transportation, cons truction regulations and laws, and that either 
stand alone, or are incorporated within th e national child health policy or plan;

  3  (8) to enforce and, if necessary, strengthen the existing laws and regulations relevant to the 
prevention of child injury; 
(9) to strengthen emergency and rehabilita tion services and capacities, including firstresponse teams, acute  pre-hospital care, management at health facilities,  and suitable 
rehabilitation programmes for in jured or disabled children; 
(10) to define priorities for research, taking into consideration the WHO/UNICEF World 
report on child injury prevention , and working closely with research and development 
communities, including relevant manufacture rs and distributors of safety products; 
(11) to raise awareness  and health literacy, in particular  on child safety among parents, 
children, employers and relevant professional groups, as well as all members of the society, about risk factors for child injury, especially transport, including the use of “cell” phones and 
other such mobile devices while driving, workplace hazards,  water and fire hazards, and lack of 
child supervision and protection of children, and to advocate dedicated ch ild injury prevention 
programmes; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to collaborate with Member States in improving data collection and analysis systems for 
child injuries and in establishing science-based  public health policies and programmes for 
preventing and mitigating the consequences of child injury; 
(2) to collaborate with organizations of the Un ited Nations system, international development 
partners and nongovernmental or ganizations to establish a network to ensure effective 
coordination and implementation of activities for child injury prevention in low- and middle-income countries; 
(3) to encourage research that expands the ev idence base for interventi ons to prevent child 
injuries and mitigate their consequences, and that evaluates the effectiveness of such 
interventions through collaborating centres and other partners, including translation into 
affordable safety products, policy interv entions and effective implementation; 
(4) to facilitate the adaptation and transfer of knowledge on measures and instruments to 
prevent child injury, from developed to developing settings; 
(5) to support Member States in developing and implementing child injury prevention 
measures;

of the Millennium Development Goals, particul arly in developing, low- and middle-income 
countries where there exists a significant burden of child injuries;1 
(9) to invest more in building institutional and individual capacities among Member States so 
that they are able to develop cost-effective interventions at nationa l and subnational levels; 
(10) to report progress made in implementing th is resolution, through the Executive Board, to
