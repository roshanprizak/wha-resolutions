WHA3.33  Dental  Hygiene 
Whereas  dental  diseases  are universal  and affect  adversely  the health  and efficiency  of millions  of individuals  throughout  the world  ; 
Whereas  a study  of these  conditions  on a world-wide  basis  may  contribute  to a better  understanding  of 
factors  such  as malnutrition  underlying  dental  diseases,  and 
Whereas  the application  of known  preventive  and  corrective  measures  designed  to prevent,  correct,  or 
eliminate  dental  diseases  appears  eminently  desirable, 
The Third  World  Health  Assembly 
1. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  and  the Director-General  to study  the problem  of dental  health  with  a 
view  to presenting  a programme  in this  field  for consideration  by the Fourth  World  Health  Assembly,  and 
2. CALLS  on all research  institutes  concerned  with  the problem  of dental  health  to collaborate  with  WHO  in 
the study  of this  problem.
