The Second  World  Health  Assembly 
(1) NOTES  the report  of the Expert  Committee  on Insecticides  on its first  session  ; 28 and 
Considering  that  the  report  contains  technical  information  and  advice  for  the 
Expert  Committee  on Malaria  and  the Expert  Committee  on International  Epidemiology 
and Quarantine, 
(2) REFERS  this  report  to the  above-mentioned  expert  committees,  together  with  the 
observations  contained  in the  summary  records  relating  to the  discussions  on the 
subject  ; 29 
(3) REQUESTS  the Director-General  to refer  to the  attention  of the Economic  and  Social 
Council  at its next  session  the serious  consideration  of the  proposal  that  countries  waive 
customs  duties  on material  for insect  control  in view  of the  very  important  sanitary 
and economic  benefits  to be expected  from  their  use  on a large  scale  ; and 
(4) RECOMMENDS  to all governments  that  they  require  from  manufacturers  of insecticidal 
products  the  correct  labelling  of such  products  as regards  their  content  in active  ingredients.  Such  requirement  need  not,  however,  be imposed  in those  countries  where  the 
national  authorities  have  developed  a machinery  whereby  insecticidal  products  are 
tested  for  efficacy  for  specific  purposes  and  are  officially  " approved  " for  the  said 
purposes.
