Agenda item 11.17 21 May 2010 
Availability, safety and quality of blood products 
 
The Sixty-third World Health Assembly, 
Recalling resolution WHA58.13 on blood safety: proposal to establish World Blood Donor Day 
and preceding related resolutions since resoluti on WHA28.72 on utilization and supply of human 
blood and blood products, which urged Member St ates to promote the full implementation of wellorganized, nationally coordinated and sustainabl e blood programmes with appropriate regulatory 
systems and to enact effective legislati on governing the operation of blood services; 
Recognizing that achieving self-sufficiency, unless special circumstances preclude it, in the 
supply of safe blood components based on volunt ary, non-remunerated blood donation, and the 
security of that supply are important national go als to prevent blood shortages and meet the 
transfusion requirements of the patient population;  
Conscious that plasma-derived medicinal products  for the treatment of haemophilia and immune 
diseases are included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines1 and of the need to facilitate 
access to these products by developing countries; 
Concerned by the unequal access globally to bl ood products, particularly plasma-derived 
medicinal products, leaving many patients in need  of transfusion and with severe congenital and 
acquired disorders without adequate treatment; 
Aware that a major factor limiting the global av ailability of plasma-derived medicinal products 
is an inadequate supply of plasma meeting inte rnationally recognized standards for fractionation; 
Bearing in mind that treatment using labile blood components is gradually being included in 
medical practice in developing countries and that thereby increased quantities of recovered plasma 
should become available for fractionation into plasma -derived medicinal products to meet their needs; 
Concerned that in developing countries, blood components separation technology and 
fractionation capacity are lacking, and that, because of  insufficient regulatory controls and failure to 
implement appropriate practices in  blood establishments, plasma from developing countries is often 
unacceptable for contract fractionation, with considerable wastage of plasma as a result; 
                                                      
1 The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines identifies i ndividual medicines that togeth er could provide safe and 
effective treatment for most communicable and noncommunicable  diseases. This List includes plasma-derived medicinal 
products, namely immunoglobulins and coagula tion factors, which are needed to pr event and treat a variety of serious 
conditions that occur worldwide (http ://www.who.int/medicines/ publications/essentialmedic ines/en/index.html). WHA63.12 
 
 
  
 
 
2 Convinced that assuring the suitability of plasma  for fractionation requires the establishment of 
a nationally coordinated and sustainable plasma programme within a properly organized, legally 
established and regulated national blood programme; 
Recognizing that, as the capacity to collect plas ma is limited and would not suffice to produce 
enough essential medicines to cover global needs, it is  essential that all countries have local capacity 
to collect plasma of acceptable quality and safety from voluntary and unpaid donations in order to 
meet their needs; 
Convinced that fractionation should be set up as close to the source as possible, and that, where 
national plasma fractionation capacities are lacki ng, there should be an option for supply of 
fractionation capacity in other countries, ensuring that the supply of plasma derived medicinal 
products can be made available to meet local needs in the country of the plasma supplier; 
Recognizing that access to information about stra tegies to ensure supplies of blood products 
sufficient to meet demand, effec tive mechanisms of regulatory oversight, technologies to ensure the 
quality and safety of blood produc ts, and guidelines on the appropriate clinical use of blood products 
and the risks of transfusion have become more and more necessary; 
Bearing in mind that voluntary and non-remunerated blood donations can contribute to high 
safety standards for blood and blood components, and being aware that the safety of blood products 
depends on testing of all donated bl ood for transfusion-transmissible infections, and correct labelling, 
storage and transportation of blood products; 
Bearing in mind that patient blood management  means that before surgery every reasonable 
measure should be taken to optimiz e the patient’s own blood volume, to minimize the patient’s blood 
loss and to harness and optimize the patient-specifi c physiological tolerance of anaemia following 
WHO’s guide for optimal clinical use (thr ee pillars of patient blood management); 
Recognizing that excessive and unnecessary use of transfusions and of plasma-derived 
medicinal products, unsafe transfusion practices, and errors (particularly at the patient’s bedside) 
seriously compromise patient safety;  
Concerned that unsafe and/or poor-quality blo od products can render pa tients vulnerable to 
avoidable risk if the blood programmes are not subject to the level of control now exercised by 
experienced national or regional regulatory authorities; 
Alarmed that patients in developing countries conti nue to be exposed to the risk of preventable 
transfusion-transmitted infections by bloodborne pathogens such as he patitis B virus, hepatitis C virus 
and HIV; 
Noting the increasing movement across boundari es of blood products and blood safety-related 
in vitro diagnostic devices, together with their ra pid development and introd uction into health-care 
systems of both developed and developing countries; 
Recognizing the value of international biologi cal reference material s (WHO International 
Standards) for the quality control of blood prod ucts and related in vitro diagnostic devices for 
detection of known and em erging bloodborne pathogens;   WHA63.12 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  Convinced that traceability at all stages of the pr eparation of blood pro ducts, from the donor to 
the recipient and vice versa, is essential to identify  risks, particularly the tr ansmission of pathogens and 
transfusion reactions, and to monitor the efficacy of corrective measures aiming to minimize such risks; 
Convinced that good practices need to be  implemented for recruiting voluntary, nonremunerated healthy blood and plasma donors from lo w-risk donor populations and testing of all 
donated blood for transfusion-transmissible pathogens , and that the whole chain of processes in the 
production of blood products, i.e. correct processing, la belling, storage and transportation, needs to be 
covered by relevant, reliable quality-assurance systems;  
Recognizing that stringent regulatory control is vital in assuring the quality and safety of blood 
products, as well as of related in vitro diagnostic devices, and that special effort is needed to 
strengthen globally the technical cap acity of regulatory authorities to  assure the appropriate control 
worldwide; 
Recalling previous resolutions of the Health Asse mbly mentioning the vital need to strengthen 
blood establishments and ensure the quality , safety and efficacy of blood products, 
1. URGES Member States:1
