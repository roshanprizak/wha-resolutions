WHA31.13 Documentation  and  languages  of the Health  Assembly  and  the Executive  Board  1 
The Thirty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  resolution  EB60.R7  of the Executive  Board  and  the  report  of the Board's  Ad Hoc 
Committee  on Documentation  and  Languages  of the Health  Assembly  and  the Executive  Board;2 
I 
Recognizing  that  the concept  of official  languages  in WHO  relates  at present  to interpretation  of speeches 
made  in those  languages,  whereas  the concept  of working  languages  relates  essentially  to translation  and  is 
applied  on a pragmatic  basis,  taking  into  account  the  specific  requirements  of Member  States,  the  Health 
Assembly  and  the Executive  Board  ； 
DECIDES： 
(1) that,  as regards  the official  languages  of the Health  Assembly  and  the Executive  Board,  the present 
practice,  whereby  interpretation  from  and  into  those  languages  is on the basis  of complete  parity,  should 
be maintained  ； 
(2) that  Arabic,  Chinese,  English,  French,  Russian  and  Spanish  shall  continue  to be the  working 
languages,  the  practices  and  decisions  extending  or limiting  their  use  in varying  degrees  being  allowed 
to remain,  except  for any  further  modifications  which  may  result  from  agreements  negotiated  between  the 
governments  concerned  and  the Organization  ； 
II 
Conscious  of the need  to cut out all avoidable  and  non-essential  expenditure  in accordance  with  resolution 
WHA29.48; 
Being  informed  that  certain  savings  could  be achieved  by issuing  in nonserial  form  the volumes  that  at 
present  form  the  Official  Records  series,  since  this  would  make  possible  a less  extensive  free  distribution 
outside  the Organization; 
Convinced  that  the issue  of a number  of separate  volumes  would  fulfil  the same  purpose  as the Official 
Records  series,  and  would  continue  to meet  the needs  of Member  States  ； 
DECIDES： 
(1) that  the present  Official  Records  series  shall  be replaced  by a number  of separate  volumes; 
(2) that  Rule  95 of the Rules  of Procedure  of the Health  Assembly  shall  be amended  by the deletion 
of the words:  “in the Official  Records  of the Organization"; 
III 
1. DECIDES  in 1979  and  future  years  to maintain  the status  quo  regarding  the translation  and  publication  of 
the verbatim  records  of the Health  Assembly  and  the summary  records  of the Executive  Board  and  the main 
committees  of the Health  Assembly; 
2. INVITES  the  Director-General,  in future  years,  to take  the  necessary  measures  to comply  with  the 
above  provisions,  giving  due  consideration  to resolution  WHA29.48.  •
