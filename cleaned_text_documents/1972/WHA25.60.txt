The Twenty-fifth World Health Assembly, Noting, that in the course of the rapidly accelerating general scientific and technical progress science is being transformed into a major productive force of society, and that there is every ground to anticipate in the future major discoveries in the fields of biology and medicine, which may have important social and economic consequences Reaffirming its conviction that the achievements of biology and medicine should be utilized only for the benefit of mankind, and constitute a basis for the effective planning of health systems and services in the development of measures aimed at the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health Noting the existence of a considerable gap between the achievements of research in the biomedical sciences and their practical application in services for the promotion of health inmost countries Recognizing the need for more complete and economic utilization of the resources and manpower allotted by countries for the purposes of biomedical research through the most rapid possible general dissemination and application of the results of scientific progress Considering also the creation of conditions for the application of the results of biomedical research to the development of health services tobe a major task of all governments and international organizations Recalling, among others, resolutions WHA7.52, WHA11.35, WHA12.17, WHA13.64, WHA15.52 and WHA17.36, stressing the importance of biomedical research for the solution of practical health problems for the economically developed and the developing countries alike Stressing that the Fifth General Programme of Work1 envisages a strengthening of WHO's role in stimulating and coordinating biomedical research, and securing its application to health services development; Recognizing that the further success of WHO activities is toa considerable extent dependent on gains in biomedical research and the practical application of its results generally on behalf of the health of peoples of all countries, 1. CONSIDERS it necessary to intensify WHO activities in the field of biomedical research, particularly in regard to the development of its long-term programmes; 2. CONSIDERS further the major objectives of WHO in the field of biomedical research tobe : (i) the identification of those fields of biology and medical sciences in which there is the greatest prospect of advance and the promotion of their development (ii) the development and elaboration inter alia of {a) opportunities and methods for international cooperation in the biomedical sciences (b) standardization of research techniques, when feasible; (c) standardization of nomenclature and terminology, in order to ensure the comparability of results (iii) coordination of the efforts of research institutions in countries which show a readiness to provide the necessary facilities and manpower for collaborative work on priority problems (iv) collection and transmission to the Member States of information and the results of experience regarding the most rational ways of making practical use in health programmes of scientific advances (V) assisting countries to obtain access to training in research methods for suitable medical and other scientists, especially for young ones, who wish to work in biomedical research and to participate in the evaluation of this research and its results 3. REQUESTS the Director-General to prepare proposals for the development of long-term WHO activities in biomedical research within the framework of the programmes being carried outby the Organization, with special reference to international coordination and within the limits of the available resources; and to report on the matter to the fifty-first session of the Executive Board and the Twenty-sixth World Health Assembly.
