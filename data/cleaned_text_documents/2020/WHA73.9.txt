URGES Member States:2 (1) as appropriate to national context, to identify meningitis as a political priority through its inclusion in national policies and plans, either as a stand-alone plan or embedded within broader health initiatives; (2) to establish national targets and to develop and implement, in the context of national priorities, through an integrated meningitis control plan, multidisciplinary, selected, cost-effective prevention and control measures and provision of services, including equitable access to safe, effective, good-quality and affordable vaccines, and treatments, prophylactic measures, targeted control interventions, diagnostics, appropriate health care, including rehabilitation care, and sustainable financing models adapted to the local transmission pattern for long-term control and elimination of epidemics; (3) to ensure that national policies and plans regarding the prevention and management of meningitis cover all areas at high risk of meningitis transmission; (4) in partnership with other groups involved in care for persons with disabilities, to develop and strengthen services aiming to reduce the burden of sequelae for individuals who had previously contracted meningitis and who now live with disabilities; (5) to establish, in line with national contexts and priorities, integrated national multidisciplinary meningitis prevention and surveillance mechanisms, to coordinate the implementation of the meningitis control plan, including representation of the different ministries, agencies, partners, civil society organizations and communities involved in meningitis control efforts and rehabilitation services; (6) in order to reduce the public health, social and economic impact of meningitis, to strengthen national capacity for: preparedness, in compliance with the International Health Regulations (2005); early detection and treatment; laboratory confirmation; case management; and immediate and effective response to epidemics of meningitis; (7) to strengthen surveillance and early reporting of meningitis by national surveillance systems in line with the International Health Regulations (2005) and national priorities, and build capacity for data collection and analysis, including for sequelae; (8) to strengthen community engagement, communication and social mobilization in meningitis prevention, early detection, health-seeking behaviour, rehabilitation and other related activities; (9) to support, including through international cooperation, research and innovation to better prevent and control meningitis by means of: improved vaccines and vaccination strategies; better 1 Global road map on defeating meningitis by 2030.

REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to reinforce advocacy, strategic leadership and coordination with partners at all levels including, as appropriate, by means of the Technical Taskforce on defeating meningitis by 2030; (2) to increase capacity to provide support to countries to scale up their ability to implement and monitor multidisciplinary, integrated interventions: for long-term meningitis prevention and control, including elimination of epidemics and provision of access to appropriate support and care services for affected people and families; for preparedness and response to meningitis epidemics, in accordance with the global initiative Defeating meningitis by 2030 and aligned with national plans to encourage reporting and monitor progress and disease burden in order to inform country and global strategies; and for control or elimination of epidemics; (3) to provide support to countries, upon request, in the assessment of meningitis risk factors and capacity for multidisciplinary engagement, within existing technical resources and in line with national contexts and priorities; (4) to continue leading the management of the meningitis vaccine stockpile, developing strategies to ensure sufficient vaccine stockpile at the optimal level (global, regional, national or subnational) in consultation with Member States and in collaboration with partners and vaccine manufacturers, while promoting expansion and diversification of vaccine producers; and to promote equitable access, including by providing support to gradually transition from polysaccharide to safe, good-quality, effective, affordable multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines to respond to outbreaks, and where appropriate, supporting vaccination campaigns, in cooperation with relevant organizations and partners, including but not limited to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Mdecins Sans Frontires International, UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; (5) to monitor and support, upon request, long-term meningitis prevention and control programmes at country and regional levels; (6) to develop and promote an outcome-oriented research and innovation agenda for meningitis, in particular in developing countries, targeted at: closing important knowledge gaps; improving implementation of existing interventions, including best prevention practices and rehabilitation; and developing improved vaccines and vaccination strategies for better and more durable prevention and outbreak control, covering all aspects of meningitis control; (7) to raise the profile of meningitis at the highest levels on the global public health agenda, and to strengthen the coordination and engagement of multiple sectors; (8) to submit a report to the Executive Board at its 150th session on progress in implementing this resolution, and a report to the Seventy-sixth World Health Assembly, through the Executive Board at its 152nd session, to review the global meningitis situation and assess efforts made in meningitis prevention and control.
