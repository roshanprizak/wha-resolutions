Considering that the World Health Organization is by its nature atechnical organization whose objective is the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health ; Considering that atechnical organization such as WHO should not be called upon to judge or to determine questions of a political character, the settlement of which will not be obtained by a decision of the World Health Assembly ; Considering that there exist other political or judicial bodies having such competence and which are better qualified to deal with such differences ; Considering that it is highly desirable that the task conferred upon the World Health Organization maybe accomplished fully and without obstacles, The Sixth World Health Assembly, Neither able nor wishing to interfere in the differences existing between States in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, but moved by the high conception of the duties which fall upon the community of the States Members of the Organization, 1. DECIDES to postpone sine die the examination of the question of the absence of meetings of the regional committee ; 2. EXPRESSES the wish that the Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean should provisionally carry out its duties through being divided into two sub-committees, the constitution of which would be fixed inaccordance with the wishes of the countries concerned ; and 3. REQUESTS the Director-General, with the means at his disposal, to continue to supply technical aid and services to all Members of the Region.
