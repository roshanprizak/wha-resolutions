THIRTY-NINTH  WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA39.28 
Agenda item 21 16  May 1986 
INFANT AND YOUNG CHILD FEEDING 
The Thirty-ninth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA27.43,  WHA31.47,  WHA33.32,  WHA34.22,  WHA35.26  and WHA37.30 
which dealt with infant and young child feeding; 
Having considered  the Progress  and Evaluation  Report on Infant and Young Child 
Nutrition;^ 
Recognizing  that the implementation  of the International  Code of Marketings  of 
Breast-milk  Substitutes  is an important  contribution  to healthy  infant and young child 
feeding in all countries； 
Aware that today, five years after the adoption  of. the International  Code; many Member 
States have made substantial  efforts  to implement  it, but that many products  unsuitable  for 
infant feeding  are nonetheless  >being promoted  and used for this purpose；  and thart sustained 
and concerted  efforts  will therefore  continue  to be necessary  to achieve  full implementation 
of and compliance  with the International  Code as well as the cessation  of the marketing  of 
unsuitable  products  and the improper  promotion  of breast-milk  substitutes; 
Noting with great satisfaction  the Guidelines  concerning  the main health and 
socioeconomic  circumstances  in which infants  have to be fed on breast-milk  substitutes,^  in 
the context  of Article  6, paragraph  6, of the International  Code; 
Noting further  the statement  in the Guidelines,  paragraph  47: "Since  the large majority 
of infants  born in maternity  wards and hospitals  are full term, they require  no nourishment 
other than colostrum  during their first 24-48 hours of life - the amount of time often spent 
by a mother and her infant in such an institutional  setting.  Only small quantities  of 
breast-milk  substitutes  are ordinarily  required  to meet the needs of a minority  of infants  in 
these facilities,  and they should only be available  in ways that do not interfere  with the 
protection  and promotion  of breast-feeding  for the majority.M; 
1. ENDORSES  the report of the Director-General;1 
2. URGES  Member States: 
(1) to implement  the Code if they have not yet done so; 
(2) to ensure that the practices  and procedures  of their health care systems  are 
consistent  with the principles  and aim of the International  Code;

(3) to make the fullest  use of all concerned  parties  - health professional  bodies, 
nongovernmental  organizations,  consumer  organizations,  manufacturers  and distributors  generally,  in protecting  and promoting  breast-feeding  and, specifically,  in implementing 
the Code and monitoring  its implementation  and compliance  with its provisions； 
(4) to seek the cooperation  of manufacturers  and distributors  of products  within the 
scope of Article  2 of the Code, in providing  all information  considered  necessary  for 
monitoring  the implementation  of the Code; 
(5) to provide  the Director-General  with complete  and detailed  information  on the 
implementation  of the Code; 
(6) to ensure that the small amounts  of breast-milk  substitutes  needed for the minority 
of infants  who require  them in maternity  wards and hospitals  are made available  through 
the normal procurement  channels  and not through  free or subsidized  supplies； 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General 
(1) to propose  a simplified  and standardized  form for use by Member States to 
facilitate  the monitoring  and evaluation  by them of their implementation  of the Code and 
reporting  thereon  to WHO, as well as the preparation  by WHO of a consolidated  report by 
each of the articles  of the Code; 
(2) to specifically  direct the attention  of Member States and other interested  parties 
to the facts that: ‘ 
(a) any food or drink given before complementary  feeding  is nutritionally  required 
may interfere  with the initiation  or maintenance  of breast-feeding  and therefore 
should neither  be promoted  nor encouraged  for use by infants  during this period; 
...‘ - -,  ....‘  •  •  ...�  .  .... 
(的 the practice  being introduced  in some countries  of providing  infants  with 
specially  formulated  milks (so-called  "follow-up"  milks) is not necessary.
