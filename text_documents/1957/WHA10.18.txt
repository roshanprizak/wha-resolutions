WHA10.18  Epidemiology  of Cancer 
The Tenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Aware  that  cancer  is a source  of untold  suffering  to thousands  of people,  that  it casts  a shadow  over 
many  a home,  and  that  its repercussions  cannot  fail  to have  a considerable  impact  on economic  and 
social  well-being,  especially  in countries  with  an aging  population; 
Aware  that  cancer  puts  an end  to the lives  of thousands  of people  each  day  throughout  the world  and 
that its problems  continue  to baffle  the research  of medical  science;  and 
Considering  that  the  epidemiological  study  of cancer  is well  suited  to international  action, 
REQUESTS  the  Director-General  : 
(1) to continue  the  collection  and  publication  of international  statistics,  mainly  of mortality,  but 
also of morbidity  so far as practicable; 
(2) to continue  work  on formulating  international  definitions  of nomenclature  and  statistical  classification,  including  cancer  staging; 
(3) to provide  an advisory  centre  on the  objectives  and  methods  of cancer  registration; 
(4) to consider  the  desirability  and  urgency  of both  co-ordinating  and  expanding  work  on cancer 
epidemiology  and  statistics  in order  to contribute  more  effectively  to national  needs  through  improved 
international  liaison;  and 
(5) to include  in the epidemiological  work  on cancer  due  reference  to occupational  and  other  environmental  conditions  likely  to have  an influence  on the frequency  of the various  forms  of the disease  and 
therefore  an etiological  significance.
