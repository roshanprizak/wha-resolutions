5 ANNEX 
Global strategy on public health, innovation and 
intellectual property 
 
 
The context 
1. In resolution WHA59.24 the Health Assembly recognized the growing burden of diseases and 
conditions that disproportionately affect developing countries, and particularly women and children. 
Reducing the very high incidence of communicable diseases in those countries is an overriding priority. At the same time, it is important fo r WHO Member States and the WHO Secretariat to 
recognize and better address the increasing preval ence of noncommunicable diseases in those 
countries. 
2. Currently, 4.8 billion people live in developi ng countries, representing 80% of the world 
population. Of this number, 2.7 billion, representing 43% of the world population, live on less than 
US$ 2 a day. Communicable diseases account for 50% of the developing countries’ burden of disease. Furthermore, poverty, among other factors, direct ly affects the acquisition of health products
1 and 
medical devices, especially in developing countries.  
3. Member States,2 the pharmaceutical industry, charitable foundations and nongovernmental 
organizations have taken initiatives in recent years to develop new products against diseases affecting 
developing countries and to increase access to existing health products and medical devices. However, 
these initiatives are not sufficient to surmount the ch allenges of meeting the goal of ensuring access 
and innovation for needed health pr oducts and medical devices. More efforts should be made to avoid 
suffering and reduce preventable mortality and to meet the health-related Millennium Development 
Goals and to implement States’ obligations and co mmitments arising under applicable international 
human rights instruments with provisions relevant to health. 
4. Proposals should be developed for health-needs dr iven research and development that include 
exploring a range of incentive mechanisms, including  where appropriate, addressing the de-linkage of 
the costs of research and development and the pri ce of health products and methods for tailoring the 
optimal mix of incentives to a particular condition or product with the objective of addressing diseases 
that disproportionately affect developing countries. 
5. Advances in biomedical science have provided opportunities to develop new, affordable, safe 
and effective health products and medical devices, pa rticularly those that meet public health needs. 
Urgent efforts should be made to make these advances more affordable, accessible and widely 
available in developing countries. 
                                                      
1 The term “health products” hereafter should be unders tood to include vaccines, di agnostics and medicines in 
accordance with resolution WHA59.24. 
2 Where applicable, also regional economic integration organizations. 
 WHA61.21  Annex 
 
 
  
 
 
6 6. The Report of the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health 
provides an analysis of the problems and makes reco mmendations that form a basis of future actions. 
7. Intellectual property rights are an important in centive for the development of new health-care 
products. This incentive alone does not meet the need  for the development of new products to fight 
diseases where the potential paying market is small or uncertain. 
8. The Doha Ministerial Declaration on the TRIPS Ag reement and Public Health confirms that the 
agreement does not and should not prevent Member s from taking measures to protect public health. 
The declaration, while reiterating commitment to  the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), affirms that the Agreement can and s hould be interpreted and 
implemented in a manner supportive of the rights of WTO Members to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all. 
9. Article 7 of the TRIPS agreement states that “t he protection and enforc ement of intellectual 
property rights should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation into the transfer and 
dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and ec onomic welfare, and to a balance of rights and 
obligations”. 
10. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that “everyone has the right freely to 
participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific 
advancement and its benef its” and that “everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and 
material interests resulting from an y scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the 
author”. 
11. The price of medicines is one of the factors that can impede access to treatment. 
12. International intellectual property agreements c ontain flexibilities that could facilitate increased 
access to pharmaceutical products by developing co untries. However, developing countries may face 
obstacles in the use of these flexibilities. These c ountries may benefit, inter alia, from technical 
assistance. 
The aim 
13. The global strategy on public health, innovation an d intellectual property aims to promote new 
thinking on innovation and access to medicines, as  well as, based on the recommendations of the 
CIPIH report, provide a medium-term framework for securing an enhanced and sustainable basis for needs driven essential health research and developm ent relevant to diseases which disproportionately 
affect developing countries, proposing clear objec tives and priorities for R&D, and estimating funding 
needs in this area. Annex  WHA61.21 
 
 
  
 
 
  7  14. The elements of the global strategy, which are designed to promote innovation, build capacity, 
improve access and mobilize resources, will: 
(a) provide an assessment of the public health needs of developing countries with respect to 
diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries and identify their R&D priorities at 
the national, regional and international levels  
(b) promote R&D focusing on Type II and T ype III diseases and the specific R&D needs of 
developing countries in relation to Type I diseases1 
(c) build and improve innovative capacity for r esearch and development, particularly in 
developing countries 
(d) improve, promote and accelerate transfer of technology between developed and 
developing countries as well as among developing countries 
(e) encourage and support the application and management of intellectual property in a 
manner that maximizes health-related innovati on, especially to meet the R&D needs of 
developing countries, protects public health and pr omotes access to medicines for all, as well as 
explore and implement, where appropr iate, possible incentive schemes for R&D 
(f) improve delivery of and access to all health  products and medical devices by effectively 
overcoming barriers to access 
(g) secure and enhance sustainable financi ng mechanisms for R&D and to develop and 
deliver health products and medical devices to a ddress the health needs of developing countries 
(h) develop mechanisms to monitor and evaluate  the implementation of the strategy and plan 
of action, including reporting systems. 
The principles  
15.  The WHO Constitution states that “the objective of  WHO shall be the attainment by all peoples 
of the highest possible level of health”. Accordingly,  the WHO shall play a strategic and central role in 
the relationship between public health and innova tion and intellectual prope rty within its mandates 
(including those contained in relevant WHA r esolutions), capacities and constitutional objectives, 
bearing in mind those of other relevant intergovern mental organizations. In this context, the WHO, 
including the regional and, when appropriate, count ry offices, need to strengthen its institutional 
competencies and relevant programs in order to play its role in implementing this global strategy with 
its plan of action. 
16. The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of 
every human being without distinction of race, relig ion, political belief, economic or social condition. 
                                                      
1 For the purposes of this strategy, the definitions of Type I, II and III diseases, are as referred to by the Commission on 
Macroeconomics and Health and as furt her elaborated in the CIPIH report: Type I diseases  are incident in both rich and poor 
countries, with large numbers of  vulnerable populations in each. Type II diseases  are incident in both rich and poor countries, 
but with a substantial proportion of the cases in poor countries.  Type III diseases  are those that ar e overwhelmingly or 
exclusively incident in devel oping countries. The prevalence of  diseases and thereby their cat egorization in the typology can 
evolve over time. WHA61.21  Annex 
 
 
  
 
 
8 17. (Deleted) 
18. (Deleted) 
19. The promotion of technological innovation and the transfer of technology should be pursued by 
all states and supported by intellectual property rights. 
20. Intellectual property rights do not and should not prevent Member States from taking measures 
to protect public health. 
21. International negotiations on issues related to in tellectual property rights and health should be 
coherent in their approaches to the promotion of public health. 
22. The strengthening of the innovative capacity of de veloping countries is essential to respond to 
the needs of public health. 
23. Research and development of developed countri es should better reflect the health needs of 
developing countries. 
24. The global strategy and the plan of action shoul d promote the development of health products 
and medical devices needed by Member States, especially developing countries, that are: 
(i) developed in an ethical manner 
(ii) available in sufficient quantities 
(iii) effective, safe  and of good quality 
(iv) affordable and accessible 
(v) used in a rational way. 
25. Intellectual property rights are an important in centive in the development of new health care 
products. However, this incentive alone does not meet  the need for the development of new products 
to fight diseases where the potential paying market is small or uncertain. 
26. Several factors contribute to the price of h ealth products and medical devices, and public 
policies should address these factors to increase their affordability and accessibility. Among others, 
competition and reduction or elimin ation of import tariffs on these products and devices can contribute 
to the reduction of prices. Countries should monito r carefully supply and distribution chains and 
procurement practices to minimize costs that could adversely influence the price of these products and 
devices. 
The elements 
Element 1. Prioritizing research and development needs 
27. Health research and development policies of developed countries need to reflect adequately the 
health needs of developing countries. Gaps in research on Type II and Type III diseases and on the 
specific R&D needs of developing countries in re lation to Type I diseases need to be identified Annex  WHA61.21 
 
 
  
 
 
  9  urgently. A better understanding of the devel oping countries' health needs, and their  determinants is 
essential to drive sustainable research and development on new a nd existing products. 
28. The actions to be taken to prioritize research and development needs are as follows: 
(1.1) mapping global research and development w ith a view to identifying gaps in research and 
development on diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries 
(a) develop methodologies and mechanisms to identify gaps in research on Type II and 
Type III diseases and on developing countries’ specific R&D needs in relation to Type I diseases 
(b) disseminate information on identified gaps , and evaluate their consequences on 
public health 
(c) provide an assessment of identified gaps  at different levels – national, regional and 
international – to guide research aimed at  developing affordable and therapeutically 
sound products to meet public health needs. 
(1.2) formulating explicit prioritized strategies  for research and development at country and 
regional and inter-regional levels 
(a) set research priorities so as to add ress public health needs and implement public 
health policy based on appropriate and regular needs assessments 
(b) conduct research appropriate fo r resource-poor settings and research on 
technologically appropriate products for addressing public health needs to combat 
diseases in developing countries 
(c) include research and development needs on heal th systems in a prioritized strategy  
(d) urge the leadership and commitment of governments, regional and international 
organizations and the private sector in determining priorities for R&D to address public health need 
(e) increase overall R&D effort s on diseases that disproportionately affect developing 
countries, leading to the development of quality products to address public health needs, 
user friendly (in terms of use, prescription and management) and accessible (in terms of availability and affordability). 
(1.3) encouraging research and development in traditional medicine in accordance with 
national priorities and legislation, and taking into  account the relevant international instruments, 
including, as appropriate, those concerning trad itional knowledge and the rights of indigenous

Element 2. Promoting research and development 
29. There are many determinants of innovation cap acity. Political, economic and social institutions 
in each country should participate in the devel opment of health research policy, taking into 
consideration their own realities and needs. The range of measures to promote,  coordinate and finance 
public and private research in both developed and developing countries into Type II and Type III 
diseases and into the needs of developing countri es in relation to Type I diseases needs to be 
substantially enhanced. Greater investment, in both  developed and developing  countries, is essential. 
30. The actions to be taken to promote re search and development are as follows: 
(2.1) supporting governments to develop or im prove national health research programmes and 
establish, where appropriate, strategic research networks to facilitate better coordination of 
stakeholders in this area

research on public health, and suggest ways to  facilitate access to research results and 
research tools 
(d) support basic and applied scientific rese arch on Type II and Type III diseases and 
on the specific R&D needs of developing c ountries in relation to Type I diseases Annex  WHA61.21 
 
 
  
 
 
  11  (e) support early-stage drug research and development in developing countries 
(f) build capacity to conduct clinical tria ls and promote public and other sources of 
funding for clinical trials and other mechanism s for stimulating local innovation, taking 
into account international ethical stand ards and the needs of developing countries 
(g) promote the generation, transfer, acquisition upon agreed terms and voluntary 
sharing, of new knowledge and technolog ies, consistent with national law and 
international agreements, to facilitate the development of new health products and 
medical devices to tackle the health  problems of developing countries. 
(2.3) improving cooperation, participation and c oordination of health and biomedical research 
and development  
(a) stimulate and improve global coopera tion and coordination in research and 
development, in order to optimize resources

mechanisms for essential health and biomedic al R&D, including inter alia, an essential 
health and biomedical R&D treaty  
(d) support active participation of  developing countries in building technological 
capacity 
(e) promote the active participation of devel oping countries in the innovation process. 
(2.4) Promoting greater access to knowledge and technology relevant to meet public health 
needs of developing countries  
(a) promote the creation and development of  accessible public health libraries in 
order to enhance availability and use of relev ant publications by universities, institutes 
and technical centers, especially in developing countries 
(b) promote public access to the results of government funded research, by strongly 
encouraging that all investigators funded  by governments submit to an open access 
database an electronic version of their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts 
(c) support the creation of voluntary open databases and compound libraries 
including voluntary provision of access to  drug leads identified through the screening of 
such compound libraries 
(d) encourage the further development and dissemination of public ly or donor-funded 
medical inventions and know-how through ap propriate licensing policies, including but 
not limited to open licensing, that enhance access to innovations for development of 
products of relevance to the public health needs of developing countries on reasonable, 
affordable and non-discriminatory terms WHA61.21  Annex 
 
 
  
 
 
12 (e) consider, where appropriate, use of a “research exception” to address public 
health needs in developing countries consis tent with the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. 
(2.5) Establishing and strengthe ning national and regional coordinating bodies on research and 
development 
(a) develop and coordinate a research and development agenda 
(b) facilitate the dissemination and u se of research and development outcomes. 
   
Element 3. Building and improving innovative capacity 
31. There is a need to frame and develop and support effective policies that promote the 
development of capacities in developing co untries related to health innovation.  Key areas for 
investment are capacities relating to science a nd technology, local production of pharmaceuticals, 
clinical trials, regulation, intellect ual property and traditional medicine. 
32. The actions to be taken to build and im prove innovative capacity are as follows:  
(3.1) building capacity of developing countries to meet research and development needs for 
health products  
(a) support investment by developing c ountries in human resources and knowledge 
bases, especially in education and tr aining including in public health  
(b) support existing and new research and development groups and institutions, 
including regional centres of excelle nce, in developing countries  
(c) strengthen health surveillance and information systems.  
(3.2) Framing, developing and supporting effective policies that promote the development of 
capacities for health innovation  
(a) establish and strengthen regulatory capacity in developing countries  
(b) strengthen human resources in research  and development in developing countries 
through long-term national capacity building plans  
(c) encourage international cooperation to develop effective policies for retention of 
health professionals including researchers in developing countries   
(d) urge Member States to establish mec hanisms to mitigate the adverse impact of the 
loss of health personnel in developing c ountries, particularly researchers, through 
migration, including by ways for both receiving and originating countries to support the 
strengthening of national health and research  systems, in particular human resource 
development in the countries of origin, taking into account the work of WHO and other relevant organizations.   Annex  WHA61.21 
 
 
  
 
 
  13  (3.3) providing support for improving innovativ e capacity in accordance with the needs of 
developing countries  
(a) develop successful health innovation mo dels in developing innovative capacity  
(b) intensify North–South and South–South partnership s and networks to support 
capacity building  
(c) establish and strengthen mechanisms for ethical review in the research and 
development process, including clinical tria ls, especially in developing countries.  
(3.4) supporting policies that will promote innova tion based on traditional medicine within an 
evidence-based framework in acco rdance with national priorities and taking into account the 
relevant provisions of relevant  international instruments  
(a) establish and strengthen national and regional policies to develop, support, 
promote traditional medicine  
(b) encourage and promote policies on innovation in the field of traditional medicine   
(c) promote standard setting to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of traditional

(d) encourage research on mechanisms for ac tion and pharmacokinetics of traditional 
medicine  
(e) promote South-South collaboratio n in traditional medicine  
(f) formulate and disseminate guidelin es on good manufacturing practices for 
traditional medicines and laying down eviden ce-based standards for quality and safety 
evaluation.  
(3.5) developing and implementing, where appropr iate, possible incentive schemes for healthrelated innovation  
(a) encourage the establishment of award schemes for health-related innovation   
(b) encourage recognition of innovation fo r purposes of career advancement for health 
researchers.   
   
Element 4. Transfer of technology 
33. North–South and South–South development cooperation,  partnerships and ne tworks need to be 
supported in order to build and improve transfer of  technology related to h ealth innovation. Article 7 
of the TRIPS Agreement states that the protection and the enforcement of intellectual property rights 
should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and the transfer and dissemination of 
technology, to the mutual advantage of produ cers and users of technological knowledge and in a 
manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to the balance of rights and obligations.  WHA61.21  Annex 
 
 
  
 
 
14 34. The actions to be taken in relation to this element are as follows: 
(4.1) promoting transfer of technology and th e production of health products in developing 
countries  
(a) explore possible new mechanisms and make better use of existing mechanisms to 
facilitate transfer of technology and techni cal support to build and improve innovative 
capacity for health-related research and development, particularly in developing 
countries  
(b) promote transfer of technology and produc tion of health products in developing 
countries through investment  and capacity building

and collaboration between institutions in d eveloping countries and the pharmaceutical 
industry  
(b) facilitate local and regional networ ks for collaboration on research and 
development and transfer of technology  
(c) continue to promote and encourage t echnology transfer to least-developed country 
members of the WTO consistent with Artic le 66.2 of the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  
(d) promote the necessary training to in crease absorptive capacity for technology 
transfer.  
(4.3) developing possible new mechanisms to promote transfer of and access to key 
health-related technologies  
(a) examine the feasibility of voluntary patent pools of upstream and downstream 
technologies to promote innovation of and a ccess to health products and medical devices  
(b) explore and, if feasible, develop possible new mechanisms to promote transfer of 
and access to key health-related technologies of  relevance to public health needs of 
developing countries especially on Type II and III diseases and the specific R&D needs of developing countries in respect of Type I diseases, which are consistent with the provisions of the TRIPS agreement and inst ruments related to that agreement, which 
provide flexibilities to take measu res to protect public health.  
 
  Annex  WHA61.21 
 
 
  
 
 
  15  Element 5. Application and management of inte llectual property to contribute to innovation 
and promote public health  
35. The international regimes on intellectual property aim, inter alia, to provide incentives for the 
development of new health products. However, incentive schemes for research and development, 
especially on Type II and Type III diseases and the specific R&D needs of developing countries in 
respect of Type I diseases, need to be explored a nd implemented, where appropriate. There is a crucial 
need to strengthen innovation capacity as well as capac ity to manage and apply intellectual property in 
developing countries, including, in particular, the use to the full of the provisions in the TRIPS Agreement and instruments related to that agreemen t, which provide flexibilities to take measures to 
protect public health.  
36. The actions to be taken in relation to this element are as follows: 
(5.1) supporting information sharing and capacity building in the application and management 
of intellectual property with respect to health  related innovation and the promotion of public 
health in developing countries   
(a) encourage and support the application and management of intellectual property in 
a manner that maximizes health-related innovation and promotes access to health 
products and that is consistent with the provisions in the TRIPS agreement and other 
WTO instruments related to that agreem ent and meets the specific R&D needs of 
developing countries  
(b) promote and support, including through international cooperation, national and 
regional institutions in their efforts to build and strengthen capacity to manage and apply 
intellectual property in a manner oriented to public health needs and priorities of 
developing countries  
(c) facilitate widespread access to, and pr omote further development of, including, if 
necessary, compiling, maintaining and upda ting, user-friendly global databases which 
contain public information on the administr ative status of health-related patents, 
including supporting the existing efforts for determining the patent status of health products, in order to strengthen national capacities for analysis of the information 
contained in those databases, and improve the quality of patents.  
(d) stimulate collaboration among pertinen t national institutions and relevant 
government departments, as well as betw een national, regional and international 
institutions, in order to promote information sharing relevant to public health needs  
(e) strengthen education and training in the application and management of

Element 6.  Improving delivery and access  
37. Support for and strengthening of health systems is vital for the success of the strategy, as are the 
stimulation of competition and the adoption of appr opriate pricing and taxation policies for health 
products. Mechanisms to regulate the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines and other health products, coupled with adherence to good manuf acturing practices and effective supply chain 
management, are critical components of a well-functioning health system.  
38. International agreements that ma y have an impact on access to health products in developing 
countries need to be regularly monitored with r espect to their development and application. Any 
flexibilities in such agreements, in cluding those contained in the TRIPS agreement and recognized by 
the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and P ublic Health that would permit improved access 
need to be considered for action by national auth orities in the light of the circumstances in their 
countries. The impact of such actions on innovation needs to be monitored.  
39. The actions to be taken to improve delivery and access are as follows:  
(6.1) encouraging increased investment in the h ealth-delivery infrastructure and financing of 
health products in order to strengthen the health system  
(a) invest in developing health-delivery in frastructure and encourage financing of 
health products  
(b) develop effective and sustainable mechanisms in least-developed countries in order

to the Declaration of Helsinki, and other appropriate texts, on ethical principles for 
medical research involving human subjects, in cluding good clinical practice guidelines  
(h) support regional networks and collaborati ve efforts to strengthen the regulation 
and implementation of clinical trials us ing appropriate standards for medicines 
evaluation and approval.  
(6.3) promoting competition to improve availa bility and affordability of health products 
consistent with public health policies and needs  
(a) support the production and introduction of  generic versions, in particular of 
essential medicines, in developing countries, through the development of national legislation and/or policies that encourage  generic production and entry, including a 
“regulatory exception” or “Bolar”-type provis ion, and which are consistent with the 
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Inte llectual Property Rights and instruments 
related to that agreement  Annex  WHA61.21 
 
 
  
 
 
  19  (b) frame and implement policies to impro ve access to safe and effective health 
products, especially essential medicines, at affordable prices, consistent with 
international agreements  
(c) consider where appropriate, inter alia, th e reduction or elimination of import 
tariffs on health products and medical d evices and the monitoring of supply and 
distribution chains and procurement pr actices to minimize cost and increase access

improve affordability of health produc ts; further support WHO’s ongoing work on 
pharmaceutical pricing 
(f) Consider, where necessary, and provided  that they are consistent with the 
provisions of the Agreement on Trade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, 
taking appropriate measures to prevent the abu se of intellectual property rights by right 
holders or the resort to practices which unrea sonably restrain trade or adversely affect 
the international transfer of technology , in the field of health products 
(g) increase information among policy makers,  users, doctors and pharmacists regarding 
generic products.   
   
Element 7. Promoting sustainable financing mechanisms  
40. In recent years donors have provided substantial additional financing to make health products 
available in developing countries through new mech anisms. Additional financing has also been 
secured for research and development activities releva nt for the control and treatment of the diseases 
covered by this strategy. Nonetheless, further f unding on a sustainable basis is essential to support a 
long-term research and development effort for pr oducts to meet the health needs of developing 
countries. The most serious gaps in financing fo r health products and research and development 
covered by this strategy need to be identified and analysed.  
41. It is important to make maximum use of and complement as appropriate and feasible current 
initiatives, thereby contributing to a flow of resources into innovation and implementation.  
42. The actions to be taken to promote sustaina ble financing mechanisms are as follows:  
(7.1) endeavouring to secure adequate and sustai nable financing for research and development, 
and improve coordination of its use, where feas ible and appropriate, in order to address the 
health needs of developing countries  
(a) establish a results-oriented and time-limited expert working group under the 
auspices of WHO and linking up with other rel evant groups to examine current financing 
and coordination of research and development,  as well as proposals for new and WHA61.21  Annex 
 
 
  
 
 
20 innovative sources of financing to stimulate R&D related to Type II and Type III diseases 
and the specific R&D needs of developing c ountries in relation to Type I diseases  
(b) consider channelling additional funds to health-oriented research organizations as 
appropriate in both the private and public  sector of developing countries and promote 
good financial management to maximize its  effectiveness as recommended by the 
resolution WHA58.34  
(c) create a database of possible sources of financing for R & D.  
(7.2) facilitating the maximum use of, and comp lementing as appropriate , existing financing, 
including that through public-private and product development partnerships , in order to develop 
and deliver safe, effective and affordable  health products and medical devices  
(a) document and disseminate best pr actices in public-private and product 
development partnerships  
(b) develop tools to periodically assess pe rformance of public-private and product 
development partnerships  
(c) support public-private and produc t development partnerships and other 
appropriate research and development in itiatives in developing countries.  
 
  
Element 8. Establishing monitoring and reporting systems 
43. Systems should be established to monitor performance and progress of this strategy. A progress 
report will be submitted to the Health Assembly through the Executive Board every two years. A 
comprehensive evaluation of the strategy will be undertaken after four years.  
44. Steps to be taken will include: 
(8.1) measuring performance and progress toward s objectives contained in the strategy and 
plan of action  
(a) establish systems to monitor perform ance and progress of the implementation of 
each element of the global strategy and plan of action  
(b) monitor and report periodically to WHO’s governing bodies on the gaps and needs 
related to health products and medical devices in developed and developing countries  
(c) continue to monitor, from a public health perspective, in consultation as 
appropriate with other international organiza tions, the impact of intellectual property 
rights and other issues addressed in the report of the Commission on Intellectual 
Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health, on the development of, and access to, health care products, and to report thereon to the Health Assembly  
(d) monitor and report on the impact of incentive mechanisms on innovation of and 
access to health products and medical devices  Annex  WHA61.21
