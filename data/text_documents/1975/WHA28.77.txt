WHA28.77  Assistance  to developing  countries  一 II 
The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  both  the increasing  costs  of health  services  and  the need  to increase  the coverage  and  quality 
of health  services  to the underserved  populations  of the world;  and 
Emphasizing  that  there  are insufficient  national  health  resources  available  to finance  such  health  service 
improvements  and  extensions  in many  countries, 
REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to increase  WHO'S  coordinating  and  catalytic  role  in order  to encourage  international  financing 
agencies  to make  long-term  and  soft  credits  available  for health  service  development  in those  countries 
planning  to extend  health  services  to their  total  population  ； and 
(2) to provide  technical  assistance  to countries  to enable  them  to fulfil  the technical  requirements  of the 
international  financing  agencies.
