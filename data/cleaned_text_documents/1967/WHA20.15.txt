The Twentieth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Director-General on the smallpox eradication programme; and Noting that smallpox continues to represent a serious world health problem notwithstanding the progress being made in the global eradication programme, 1. INVITES countries where the disease is still present to initiate or intensify their programmes leading to the eradication of smallpox as soon as possible; 2. RESOLVES : (a) to urge the governments of the countries whose eradication programmes are progressing slowly to adopt prompt measures within their available resources to eliminate any administrative difficulties that maybe hampering their campaigns, and to give the highest possible priority to the provision of funds, personnel, and supplies needed to complete those campaigns as soon as possible; (b) to recommend to the governments which are producing smallpox vaccines that special care be taken in the preparation of smallpox vaccine to ensure that it meets the purity and potency requirements established by WHO, and that in the endemic countries freeze-dried vaccine should be used ; (c) to urge the countries where migrant sections of their populations constitute a constant threat of inter-state transmission of the disease to initiate or intensify astrict surveillance programme of this group of the population; (id) to recommend that until such time as smallpox is no longer a world-wide problem the countries where the disease has been eliminated, or where an eradication programme is proceeding, establish maintenance programmes and epidemiological surveillance services; 3. REQUESTS Member States and multilateral and bilateral agencies to provide technical, financial and other support for programmes in endemic countries, particularly in the form of freeze-dried vaccine, transport, and equipment; and 4.
