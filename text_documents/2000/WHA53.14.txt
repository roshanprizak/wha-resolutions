FIFTY-THIRD WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA53.14
Agenda item 12.2 20 May 2000
HIV/AIDS: confronting the epidemic
The Fifty-third World Health Assembly,
Having considered the report by the Director-General on HIV/AIDS;Noting with deep concern that nearly 34 million people worldwide are currently living with
HIV/AIDS, and 95% are in developing countries; and that the development gains of the past 50 years,
including the increase in child survival and in life expectancy, are being reversed by the HIV/AIDS
epidemic;
Further noting that in sub-Saharan Africa, where over 23 million people are infected, HIV/AIDS
is the leading cause of death, and where more women are now infected than men; and that HIV
infection is increasing rapidly in Asia, particularly in south and south-east Asia, where 6 million
people are infected;
Recalling resolution WHA52.19 which inter alia  requests the Director-General:
to cooperate with Member States, at their request, and with international organizations in
monitoring and analysing the pharmaceutical and public health implications of relevant
international agreements, including trade agreements, so that Member States can effectively
assess and subsequently develop pharmaceutical and health policies and regulatory measuresthat address their concerns and priorities, and are able to maximize the positive and mitigatethe negative impact of those agreements;
Recognizing that poverty and inequality between men and women are driving the epidemic; and
that denial, discrimination and stigma continue to be major obstacles to an effective response to theepidemic;
Underlining the need to advocate respect for human rights in the implementation of all measures
to respond to the epidemic;
Acknowledging that political commitment is essential to deal with a problem of this magnitude;Recognizing that resources devoted to combating the epidemic both at national and international
levels are not commensurate with the magnitude of the problem;
Recalling United Nations Economic and Social Council resolution 1999/36 on human
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), which stresses , interWHA53.14
2alia, governments’ responsibility to intensify all efforts in combating AIDS through multisectoral
action;
Recalling the recent session of the United Nations Security Council devoted to the HIV/AIDS
crisis in Africa, in which the Security Council recognized that HIV/AIDS is a unique modern-day
plague that threatens the political, economic and social stability of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia,
1. URGES Member States:

political leaders of Member States, to the magnitude of the problem by allocating an appropriate

3(8) to build and strengthen partnerships between health providers and the community,

update existing databases in order to provide Member States with information on prices of
essential drugs including HIV-related drugs;

(18) to establish or to expand counselling services and voluntary confidential HIV-testing in
order to encourage health-seeking behaviour and to act as an entry point for prevention and
care;
(19) to continue research on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and to
