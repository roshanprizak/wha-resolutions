WHA2.40.  Use  of Statistical  Methods 
Having  considered  the  memorandum  on Health  Statistics  by the  United  Kingdom 
delegation,48 
The Second  World  Health  Assembly 
RESOLVES 
(1) that  in the  field  and  laboratory  investigations  and  action  carried  out  by WHO 
or with  its assistance,  the fullest  possible  use of available  statistics  and  modern  statistical 
methods  should  be made  in the planning  and  execution  of such  investigations  and  action 
and in the  evaluation  of their  results  ; 
(2) that  it is desirable  that,  wherever  suitable  health  statistics  exist  or can  be made 
available  within  a reasonable  time,  they  should  be examined  in order  to make  a preliminary  assessment  of the  need  for  the  investigation  or action  contemplated  ; 
(3) that  although  it is recognized  that,  in many  countries,  such  suitable  statistics  may 
not be readily  available,  the absence  or insufficiency  of these  statistics  should  not prevent 
investigations  and  necessary  action  being  undertaken  in those  countries  where  prima 
facie  considerations  necessitate  such  investigations  or action  ; 
(4) that  it is essential  in any  event  that  continuous  statistical  control  and  analysis 
of the  investigations  and  action  should  in efery  case  be provided  for and  carried  out 
to the  fullest  extent  practicable  ; and 
(5) that  the Director-General  be requested  to submit  to an early  meeting  of the Executive 
Board  a report  on the  present  administrative  arrangement  in the World  Health  Organization  in the  sphere  of statistics  (health,  epidemiological,  medical  and  vital)  and  to 
indicate  any  changes  he thinks  necessary  or has  carried  out.
