WHA2.41.  Joint  Programme  of FÃ€O/WHO  to increase  World  Food  Production  and  raise  Standards 
of Health  40 
Whereas  the Economic  and  Social  Council  at its sixth  session  (2 March  1948)  " invited 
the specialized  agencies  concerned  and  the regional  economic  commissions,  in consultation 
with  FAO,  to study  suitable  measures  to bring  about  an increase  in food  production  " ; 
Whereas  the present  necessity  of increasing  food  production  in the world  requires 
development  of tropical  and  subtropical  areas  where  standards  of health  in general 
should  be raised  and  in particular  where  malaria  must  be controlled  before  any  scheme 
of agricultural  development  and  settlement  can  be started  ; 
Whereas  F AO has  already  given  favourable  consideration  to joint  WHO/FAO 
broad-scale  projects  aiming  at increasing  food  production,  at raising  standards  of living 
and at achieving  malaria  control  in fertile  areas, 
The Second  World  Health  Assembly 
(1) RESOLVES  that  the  1950  programme  should  include  provision  to enable  WHO  to 
carry  out,  in collaboration  with  FAO,  general  surveys'  for the  selection  of the  areas 
where  operations  will  be undertaken  in the  following  five  years  ; and 
(2) RECOGNIZES  that  such  provision  will  involve  the  obligation  to provide  in the  programme  of WHO  for the following  five  years  for the operation  of the various  projects  ; 
and 
(3) RECOMMENDS  to FAO  that  similar  action  be taken  with  a view  to enabling  the two 
organizations  to plan  the  projects  in 1949  and  to initiating  joint  surveys  in 1950.
