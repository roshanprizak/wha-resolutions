FORTY-SIXTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA46.13 
Agenda  item  26.1  10  May  1993 
ASSESSMENT  OF NEW  MEMBERS  AND  ASSOCIATE  MEMBERS: 
ASSESSMENT  OF THE  FORMER  YUGOSLAV  REPUBLIC  OF MACEDONIA 
The Forty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  that The Former  Yugoslav  Republic  of Macedonia  became  a Member  of the World  Health 
Organization  on 22 April  1993; 
Noting  that the United  Nations  General  Assembly  has not yet established  an assessment  rate for The 
Former  Yugoslav  Republic  of Macedonia  but it is expected  that, consistent  with past practice,  when  this rate is 
determined  it will be deducted  from  the rate applicable  to Yugoslavia; 
Noting  that the contribution  payable  by The Former  Yugoslav  Republic  of Macedonia  in 1993  would  in 
effect  constitute  budgetary  income,  since  it would  be deducted  from  the previously  assessed  contribution 
payable  for that year by Yugoslavia; 
Recalling  that the Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly,  in resolution  WHA22.6,  decided  that from 
1968 new Members  shall be assessed  in accordance  with the practice  followed  by the United  Nations  in 
assessing  new Members  for their  year of admission; 
DECIDES: 
(1) that  The Former  Yugoslav  Republic  of Macedonia  shall  be assessed  for the second  year of 
the financial  period  1992-1993  and for future  financial  periods  at a rate to be fixed  by the Health 
Assembly,  as and when  an assessment  rate for this country  has been established  by the United 
Nations  General  Assembly; 
(2) that  The Former  Yugoslav  Republic  of Macedonia  shall  be assessed  at the provisional  rate of 
0.02%  for the second  year of the financial  period  1992-1993  and for future  financial  periods,  to be 
adjusted  to the definitive  assessment  rate when  established  by the Health  Assembly; 
(3) that  the 1993  instalment  of the assessment  shall be reduced  to eight-twelfths  of 0.02%; 
(4) that  the assessment  rate for The Former  Yugoslav  Republic  of Macedonia  and contributions 
payable  shall be deducted  from  those  applicable  to Yugoslavia; 
(5) that,  notwithstanding  Financial  Regulation  7.1, the 1993  contribution  of The Former  Yugoslav 
Republic  of Macedonia  shall  be accounted  for as budgetary  income  upon  receipt.
