Agenda item 16.4 26 May 20 15 
Global vaccine action plan  
 
The Sixty -eighth World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on the global  vaccine action plan;1 
Emphasizing the importance of immunization as one of the most effective interventions in 
public health and access to immunization as a key step towards access to health and universal health 
coverage;  
Acknowledging the progress made i n global immunization and the commitment under the 
2011 –2020 Decade of Vaccines to achieve immunization goals and milestones;  
Recalling resolutions WHA58.15 and WHA61.15 on the global immunization strategy, 
resolution WHA65.17 on the global vaccine action plan, resolution WHA61.21 on the global strategy 
and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property, resolution WHA54.11 on the 
WHO medicines strategy and resolution WHA67.20 on regulatory system strengthening for medical 
products;  
Noting with concern that globally immunization coverage has increased only marginally since 
the late 2000s; and that in 2013 more than 21 million children under one year of age did not complete 
the three -dose series of diphtheria -tetanus -pertussis (DTP) vac cine;  
Recognizing that the availability of new vaccines against important causes of vaccine -preventable 
diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and cervical cancer can prevent leading causes of childhood and 
women’s death;  
Acknowledging that successful natio nal immunization programmes require sustainable political 
and financial support of Member States;  
Appreciating the contributions of WHO, UNICEF, the Gavi Alliance, and all partners in their 
efforts to support the introduction of new vaccines in developing countries and strengthen 
immunization services;  
Concerned that inequities between Member States are growing, inter alia, due to the increased 
financial burden of new vaccines  and based upon those that are eligible or ineligible for financial and 
technical support from global partners;

2 Concerned that many low - and middle -income countries may not have the opportunity to access 
newer and improved vaccines, particularly because of the costs related to the procurement and 
introduction of these vaccines; and concerned at the increase of costs of overall immunization 
programmes because of increase in price of the WHO -recommended vaccines;  
Recognizing that publicly available data on vaccine prices are scarce, and that the availability of 
price information is imp ortant for facilitating Member States’ efforts towards introduction of new 
vaccines;  
Recalling many Member States’ interventions on the Health Assembly’s immunization agenda 
item each year, expressing concern over the unaffordable cost of new vaccines and appealing to the 
global community to support strategies that will reduce prices;  
Recalling the WHO global framework for expanding access to essential drugs, and its four 
components: the rational selection and use of medicines, reliable health and supply sy stems, 
sustainable financing, and affordable prices;  
Taking into account the importance of competition to reduce prices and the need to expand the 
number of manufacturers, particularly in developing countries, that can produce WHO -prequalified 
vaccines and  create a competitive market;  
Stressing the critical life -saving role of vaccines and immunization programmes and striving to 
make immunization available to all;  
Noting with concern the global shortage of certain traditional routine vaccines, for example 
BCG vaccine and combined measles -rubella vaccine;  
Acknowledging that shortages of vaccines are quite often an important cause of disruption of 
vaccination schedules and that therefore the establishment of effective and sustainable vaccine 
production, supply , procurement and delivery systems is essential to ensure access to all the necessary 
vaccines of assured quality at the right time;  
Concerned that scepticism against vaccination is continuing to grow in society despite the 
proven efficacy and safety of mo dern vaccines, and that many children do not receive life -saving 
vaccines as a result of insufficient information to parents or health care  workers or even of active 
anti-vaccination propaganda,  
1. URGES Member States:1 
(1) to allocate adequate financial a nd human resources for the introduction of vaccines into 
national immunization schedules and for sustaining strong immunization programmes in 
accordance with national priorities;  
(2) to strengthen efforts, as and where appropriate, for pooling vaccine proc urement  volumes 
in regional and interregional or other groupings, as appropriate, that will increase affordability 
by leveraging economies of scale;  
                                                      
1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations.    WHA6 8.6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  3 (3) to provide,  where possible and available, timely vaccine price data to WHO for 
publication, with the go al of increasing affordability through improved price transparency, 
particularly for new vaccines;  
(4) to seek opportunities for establishing national and regional vaccine manufacturing 
capacity, in accordance with national priorities, that can produce to national regulatory 
standards, including WHO -prequalification;   
(5) to create mechanisms to increase the availability of comparable information on 
government  funding for vaccine development and work towards strategies that enhance public 
health benefit fro m government investments in vaccine development;  
(6) to support the ongoing efforts of various partners coordinated by WHO to design and 
implement the strategies to address the vaccine and immunization gaps faced by the low - and 
middle -income countries tha t request assistance;  
(7) to improve and sustain vaccine purchasing and delivery systems in order to promote the 
uninterrupted and affordable safe supply of all the necessary vaccines and their availability to all 
immunization service providers;  
(8) to str engthen immunization advocacy and provide training to health professionals and

understanding of the benefits and risks of immunization;  
2. REQUESTS the Director -General:  
(1) to explore ways to mobilize funding to fully support collaborative efforts with 
international partners, donors, and vaccine manufacturers in order to support low - and 
middle -income countries in accessing affordable vaccines of assured quality in adequate  supply;  
(2) to continue developing and adequately managing publicly available vaccine price 
databases, like the WHO Vaccine Product, Price and Procurement project, working with 
Member States to increase availability of price information;

(4) to provide technical support and facilitate financial resources for establishing pooled
