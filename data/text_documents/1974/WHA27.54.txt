WHA27.54  Quality  control  of BCG  vaccines 
The Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Emphasizing  that  the effectiveness  of BCG  vaccination  depends  largely  on the quality  of the vaccine 
used; 
Recognizing  that  the production  and  quality  control  of freeze-dried  BCG  vaccine  require  not  only 
extensive  facilities  and  equipment  but  also  a high  degree  of specialized  technological  skill,  and that  as a result 
an increasing  number  of countries  are deciding  to refrain  from  national  production  and  to opt  for importing 
BCG  vaccine; 
Recalling  that  from  the outset  the Organization  has  monitored  the quality  of BCG  vaccine  1 and  that 
the WHO  Expert  Committee  on Tuberculosis  has  strongly  recommended  that  BCG  vaccines  used  in national 
programmes  should  be examined  by international  reference  laboratories  and  centres  ； and 
Noting  with  satisfaction  that  for all the freeze-dried  BCG  vaccine  supplied  by or through  UNICEF  this 
monitoring  consists  of quality  control  of the final  product  both  in laboratory  experiments  and  in man, 
1. URGES  Member  countries  importing  BCG  vaccine  on A bilateral  basis  to make  use  of the international 
quality  control  system  set up by the Organization  ； and 
2. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  countries  producing  BCG  vaccine  avail  themselves  of the international  system of assaying  the quality  of BCG  vaccines  until  they  have  established  a competent  national  control  service.
