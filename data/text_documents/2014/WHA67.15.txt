Agenda item 14.3 24 May 20 14 
Strengthening the role of the health system in 
addressing violence, in particular against  
women and girls, and against children  
 
The Sixty -seventh World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on addressing the global challenge of violence, in particular 
against women and girls, and against children;1 
Recalling resolution WHA49.25 (1996), which declared v iolence a leading worldwide public 
health problem, resolution WHA56.24 (2003) on implementing the recommendations of the World 
report on violence and health , and resolution WHA61.16 (2008) on the elimination of female genital 
mutilation;  
Cognizant of the m any efforts across the United Nations system to address the challenge of 
violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children including the International 
Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Ac tion, and all 
relevant United Nations General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions, as well as all 
relevant Commission on the Status of Women agreed conclusions;  
Noting that violence is defined by the WHO as “the intentional use of physical force or power, 
threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community that either 
results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or 
deprivation” ;2 
Noting also that interperso nal violence, distinguished from self -inflicted violence and collective 
violence, is divided into family and partner violence and community violence, and includes forms of 
violence throughout the life course, such as child abuse, partner violence, abuse of  the elderly, family 
members, youth violence, random acts of violence, rape or sexual assault and violence in institutional 
settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes;3 
Recalling the definition of violence against women as stated in th e 1993 Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women;4

2 Concerned that the health and well -being of millions of individuals and families is adversely 
affected by violence and that many cases go unreported;  
Further concerned that violence has heal th-related consequences including death, disability and 
physical injuries, mental health impacts and sexual and reproductive health consequences, as well as 
social consequences;  
Recognizing that health systems often are not adequately addressing the proble m of violence 
and contributing to a comprehensive multisectoral response;  
Deeply concerned that globally, one in three women experience either physical and/or sexual 
violence, including by their spouses, at least once in their lives;1 
Concerned that violence, in particular against women and girls, is often exacerbated in 
situations of humanitarian emergencies and post -conflict settings, and recognizing that national health 
systems have an important role to play in responding to its consequences;  
Notin g that preventing interpersonal violence against children – boys and girls – can contribute 
significantly to preventing interpersonal violence against women and girls and children, that being 
abused and neglected during infancy and childhood makes it more likely that people will grow up to 
perpetrate violence against women, maltreat their own children, and engage in youth violence, and 
underscoring that there is good evidence for the effectiveness of parenting -support programmes in 
preventing child abuse an d neglect in order to halt the intergenerational perpetuation of interpersonal 
violence;  
Noting also that violence against girls needs specific attention because they are subjected to 
forms of violence related to gender inequality that too often remain hid den and unrecognized by 
society, including by health providers, and while child abuse (physical, emotional) and neglect affects 
boys and girls equally, girls suffer more sexual violence;  
Deeply concerned that violence against women during pregnancy has gra ve consequences on 
the health of both the woman and the pregnancy, such as miscarriage and premature labour, and for the 
baby such as low birth weight, as well as recognizing the opportunity that antenatal care provides for 
early identification, and preven tion of the recurrence of such violence;  
Concerned that children, particularly in child -headed households, are vulnerable to violence, 
including physical, sexual and emotional violence, such as bullying, and reaffirming the need to take 
action across secto rs to promote the safety, support, protection, health care and empowerment of 
children, especially girls in child -headed households;  
Recognizing that boys and young men are among those most affected by interpersonal violence, 
which contributes greatly to t he global burden of premature death, injury and disability, particularly 
for young men, and has a serious and long -lasting impact on a person’s psychological and social 
functioning;  
Deeply concerned that interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls, and 
children, persists in every country in the world as a major global challenge to public health, and is a

  3 pervasive violation of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health and a majo r impediment to achieving gender equality, and has negative 
socioeconomic consequences;  
Recognizing that violence against women and girls is a form of discrimination, that power 
imbalances and structural inequality between men and women are among its root causes, and that 
effectively addressing violence against women and girls requires action at all levels of government 
including by the health system, as well as the engagement of civil society, the involvement of men and 
boys and the adoption and implementa tion of multifaceted and comprehensive approaches that 
promote gender equality and empowerment of women and girls and that change harmful attitudes, 
customs, practices and stereotypes ; 
Aware that the process under  way for the post -2015 development agenda may, in principle, 
contribute to addressing, from a health perspective, the health consequences of violence, in particular 
against women and girls, and children, through a comprehensive and multisectoral response;  
Acknowledging also the many regional, subr egional and national efforts aimed at coordinating 
prevention and response by health systems, to violence, in particular against women and girls and 
against children;  
Noting with great appreciation the leading role WHO has played in establishing the eviden ce 
base on the magnitude, risk and protective factors,1 consequences, prevention of and response to 
violence,2 in particular against women and girls,3 and against children, in the development of norms 
and standards, in advocacy and in supporting efforts to  strengthen research, prevention programmes 
and services for those affected by violence;4 
Also noting that addressing violence, in particular against women and girls and against children 
is included within the leadership priorities of WHO’s Twelfth General  Programme of Work 2014 –2019  
in particular to address the social, economic and environmental determinants of health ; 
Recognizing the need to scale up interpersonal violence prevention policies and programmes to 
which the health system contributes and that while some evidence -based guidance exists on effective 
interventions, more research and evaluation of these and other interventions is required;  
Stressing the importance of preventing interpersonal violence before it begins or reoccurs, and 
noting that the  role of the health system in the prevention of violence, in particular against women and 
                                                   
1 Protective factors are those that decrease or buffer against the risk and impact of violence. While much of the 
research on violence against women and violence against children ha s focused on risk factors, it is important for prevention 
also to understand protective factors. Prevention strategies and programmes aim to decrease risk factors and/or to enhance 
protective factors.

4 girls, and against children, includes supporting efforts to: reduce child maltreatment, such as through 
parenting support programmes; address substance abuse includin g the harmful use of alcohol; prevent 
the reoccurrence of violence by providing health and psychosocial care and/or rehabilitation for 
victims and perpetrators and to those who have witnessed violence; and, collect and disseminate 
evidence on the effective ness of prevention and response interventions;  
Affirming the health system’s role in advocating, as an element of prevention, for interventions 
to combat the social acceptability and tolerance of interpersonal violence, in particular against women 
and girl s, and against children, emphasizing the role such advocacy can play in promoting societal 
transformation;  
Recognizing that interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls, and against 
children, can occur within the health system itself, whic h can negatively impact the health workforce, 
the quality of health care provided and lead to disrespect and abuse of patients, and discrimination to 
access of services provided;  
Affirming the important and specific role that national health systems must p lay in identifying 
and documenting incidents of violence, and providing clinical care and appropriate referrals for those 
affected by such incidents, particularly women and girls, and children, as well as contributing to 
prevention and advocating within go vernments and among all stakeholders for an effective, 
comprehensive, multisectorial response to violence;
