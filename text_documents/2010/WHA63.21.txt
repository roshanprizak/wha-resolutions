Recalling resolution WHA58.34 on the Minister ial Summit on Health Research and resolution 
WHA60.15 on WHO’s role and responsibilities in health research; 
Recognizing the contribution of research to the development of solutions to health problems and 
the advancement of health worldwide; 
Aware that, in a rapidly changing world facing si gnificant environmental, demographic, social 
and economic challenges, research will be increasingl y essential for clarifying the nature and scope of 
health problems, and for identifying effectiv e life-saving interventions and strategies; 
Realizing the increasingly multidisciplinary and in tersectoral nature of research for health 
improvement; 
Affirming the roles and responsibilities of WHO, as  the leading global health organization, in 
health research; 
Recognizing the need to strengthen the capacity of the public sector in health research; 
Acknowledging that research activities in the pr ivate and public sectors can be mutually 
supportive and complementary in improving health globally; 
Conscious of the need to strengthen the c onduct, management and coordination of WHO’s 
activities in health research; 
Cognizant of the need to better communicate WH O’s research activities and results, especially 
to its Member States and partners;

plan of action on public health, innovation and in tellectual property and relevant conclusions and 
recommendations of the WHO Commission on  Social Determinants for Health; 
Taking into account the outcomes of the Global Ministerial Forum on Research for Health 
(Bamako, 17–19 November 2008), 
1. ENDORSES the WHO strategy on research for health; 2. URGES Member States: 
(1) to recognize the importance of research for improving health and health equity and to 
adopt and implement policies for research for health  that are aligned with national health plans, 
that include the participation of all relevant sectors, public and private, that align external 
support around mutual priorities, and th at strengthen key national institutions; 
(2) to consider drawing on the strategy on resear ch for health according to their own national 
circumstances and contexts, and as part of thei r overall policies on health and health research; 
(3) to strengthen national health research systems by improving the leadership and 
management of research fo r health, focusing on national needs, establishing effective 
institutional mechanisms for research, using ev idence in health policy development, and 
harmonizing and coordinating na tional and external support (including that of WHO); 
(4) to establish, as necessary and appropriate, governance m echanisms for research for 
health, to ensure rigorous application of good research norms and standards, including 
protection for human subjects involved in rese arch, and to promote an open dialogue between 
policy-makers and researchers on national h ealth needs, capacities and constraints; 
(5) to improve the collection of reliable health  information and data and to maximize, where 
appropriate, their free and unrestricted availability in the public domain; 
(6) to promote intersectoral collaboration and high-quality research in order to produce the 
evidence necessary for ensuring that policies adopt ed in all sectors contribute to improving 
health and health equity; 
(7) to initiate or strengthen intercountry collabor ation with the aim of obtaining efficiencies 
of scale in research through the sharing of expe riences, best practices and resources, the pooling 
of training and procurement mechanisms, and the use of common, standardized evaluation methods for research; 
(8) to consider, where appropriate, establishmen t of regional collaborating mechanisms, such 
as centres of excellence, in order to facilitate access by Member States to  the necessary research 
and expertise to meet health challenges; 
(9) to continue to pursue financing of  research for health as articulated in 
resolution WHA58.34 on the Minist erial Summit on Health Research;   WHA63.21
