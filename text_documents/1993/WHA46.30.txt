their  currencies,  the  rapid  deterioration  of their  health  care  infrastructures,  as well  as the burden  of disease 
and the  rising  cost  of health  care; 
Acknowledging  the  efforts  of the  World  Health  Organization  and  the  international  community  in support 
of African  health  development, 
1. APPEALS  to all Member  States,  bilateral  and  multilateral  development  agencies,  other  organizations  of 
the United  Nations  system  and  nongovernmental  organizations  to continue  and  to intensify  their  support  for 
developing  countries,  particularly  in Africa,  in the  implementation  of their  health-for-all  strategies;
