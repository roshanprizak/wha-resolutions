Malaria, including proposal for establishment 
of World Malaria Day 
 
The Sixtieth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on malaria, including  a proposal for the establishment of Malaria 
Day;1  
Concerned that malaria continues to cause more than one million preventable deaths a year;  
Noting that  the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculos is and Malaria, the World Bank Global 
Strategy and Booster Program, the Bill & Melinda  Gates Foundation, the Malaria Initiative of the 
President of the United States of America, and othe r donors have made substa ntial resources available; 
Welcoming the contribution to the mobilizati on of resources for development of voluntary 
innovative financing initiatives taken by groups of Member States and, in this regard, noting the 
activities of the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID ); 
Recalling that combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases is included in internationally 
agreed health-related development goals, including those contained in the M illennium Declaration;  
Mindful that the global burden of malaria n eeds to be decreased in order to reach the 
Millennium Development Goal of reducing the  mortality rate among children under five  by two thirds 
by 2015 and to help to achieve the Millennium De velopment Goals of improving maternal health and 
eradicating extreme poverty, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to apply to their specific contexts the evidenced-based policies, strategies and tools 
recommended by WHO, and performance-based mon itoring and evaluation in order to expand 
coverage with major preventive interventions in populations at risk and curative interventions 
for patients suffering from malaria and to assess programme performance and the coverage and 
impact of interventions in an effective and tim ely manner, particularly with use of the WHO 
country-profile database;

2 (2) to assign national and international resources,  both human and financial, for the provision 
of technical support in order to ensure that the most locally and epidemiologically appropriate strategies are effectively implemented and target populations are reached; 
(3) to cease progressively the provision in both the public and private sectors of oral 
artemisinin monotherapies, to promote the use of artemisinin-combination therapies, and to 
implement policies that prohibit the production, marketing, distribution and the use of  
counterfeit antimalarial medicines; 
(4) to intensify access to affordable, safe and effective antimalarial combination treatments, 
to intermittent preventive treatment in pregnanc ies, with special precautions for HIV-infected 
pregnant women who are receiving co-trimoxa zole chemotherapy, to insecticide-treated 
mosquito nets, including through the free distri bution of such nets where appropriate, and  
indoor residual spraying for malaria control with  suitable and safe insecticides, taking into 
account relevant international ru les, standards and guidelines; 
(5) to provide, whenever necessar y, in their legislation for use,  to the full, of the flexibilities 
contained in the Agreement on Trade-Related Asp ects of Intellectual Property Rights in order to 
promote access to pharmaceutical products;
1 
(6) to use all necessary administrative and legi slative means, including, where appropriate, 
the use of provisions in international agreem ents, including the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights in order to promote access to preventive technologies 
against malaria; 
(7) to aim at reducing or interrupting malaria  transmission, wherever feasible, through 
integrated vector management, promoting impr ovement of local and environmental conditions 
and healthy settings, and increasing access to basic health services,  antimalarial medicines, 
diagnostics and preventive technologies in order to reduce the disease burden;  
(8) to implement integrated approaches to malaria prevention and control through 
multisectoral collaboration and community responsibility and participation;  
2. REQUESTS international organiza tions and financing bodies:  
(1) to provide support for the development of capacities in developing countries in order to 
expand use of: reliable diagnostics,  artemisinin-based combination therapies that are appropriate 
for local drug-resistance conditions, integrated  vector management including long-lasting 
insecticide-treated nets and larvicidal measures,  indoor residual spraying with appropriate and 
safe insecticides as indicated by WHO and in  accordance with the Stockholm Convention on 
                                                      
1 “The WTO General C ouncil in its Decision of 30 August 2003 on Im plementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha 
Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and P ublic Health decided that “pharmaceutical pr oduct” means any patented product, 
or product manufactured through a patented process, of the pharmaceutical sector needed to address the public health 
problems as recognized in paragraph 1 of the Declaration. It  is understood that active ingredients necessary for its 
manufacture and diagnostic kits needed for its use would be included.”   WHA60.18 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  Persistent Organic Pollutants,1 and monitoring and evaluation systems, including use of the 
country database developed by WHO; 
(2) to increase funding for malaria cont rol, so that the relevant agencies  can continue 
providing support to countries, and to channel add itional resources into technical support so that 
the financial resources  can be absorbed and used effectively in countries;  
(3) to provide support for malaria eliminati on in areas where feasible and sustainable;  
(4) to adjust their policies so as progressively  to cease to fund the provision and distribution 
of oral artemisinin monotherapies, and to join in campaigns to prohibit the production, marketing, distribution and use of counterfeit antimalarial medicines;  
3. REQUESTS the Director-General:  
(1) to take steps to identify gaps in knowle dge about malaria control and elimination; to 
provide support for the development of new t ools for diagnostics, therapy, prevention and 
control,  and strategies; to estimate more accurately the global burden of disease and determine 
trends; to develop new tools and methods for assessing impact and cost-effectiveness of 
interventions; to build up WHO’s current rese arch on malaria, including that of the 
UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases; to provide technical support to countries for conducting operational and 
implementation research; and to mobilize resour ces and increase support for research in the 
development of new tools and strategies for prevention and control of malaria; 
(2) to strengthen and rationalize human resources for malaria by deploying  staff to country 
level, thus improving the capacity of WHO’s country offices to provide technical guidance to 
national health programmes; 
(3) to provide support to coordinating partners and countries for malaria control in refugee 
camps and in complex emergencies; 
(4) to improve the coordination between different  stakeholders in the fight against malaria;
