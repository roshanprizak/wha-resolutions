DEVELOPMENT  AND COORDINATION  OF BIOMEDICAL  AND HEALTH SERVICES  RESEARCH 
The Thirty-third  World Health Assembly 
Having considered  the Director-General1  s progress  report on the development  and 
coordination  of biomedical  and health services  research 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA25.60,  WHA27.61,  WHA28.70,  WHA29.64,  ША30.40  and WHA32.15; 
Affirming  that biomedical,  health service and health promotion  research  in particular, 
and science in general,  should be a major accelerator  of the progress  of all Member States 
towards Health for All by the Year 2000; 
Recognizing  that such research  can only be effective  if it relies on both strengthened 
national  capabilities  and international  coordination; 
Noting with concern that the achievements  of biomedical  and medicosocial  sciences  have 
not been accompanied  by a decrease  of the gap between the developed  and developing  countries 
in generating  and applying  scientific  knowledge  relevant  to health development  and promotion; 
that most developing  countries  still lack the resources,  manpower  and infrastructure  necessary 
for health research;  and that in many developed  countries  also ,the efforts and resources 
devoted to health research  are inadequate； 
1. URGES Member States to: 
(1) ensure  that biomedical,  psychosocial  and health service research  is included  in 
their national  policies,  plans and budget allocations  related to the goal of Health for 
All by the Year 2000; 
(2) intensify  their cooperation,  and particularly  the cooperation  between developed 
and developing  countries  in: 
(a) building  up or upgrading  the health research  capability  of developing  countries 
in its various forms, including  separate  research  institutes,  research  arms of 
universities,  components  of specific  health programmes  or projects,  and creation  of 
national coordinating  mechanisms  ； 
(b) ensuring  that an effective  strengthening  of national  research  capability  of 
developing  countries  is the net result of every collaborative  research  activity; 
(3) give high priority  to research  training  and to measures  that encourage  scientists 
from developing  countries  completing  their studies in developed  countries  to return home 
and apply their skills and knowledge  there through: 
(a) developing  countries  offering  appropriate  incentives,  and 
(b) countries  providing  the training  refraining  both from encouraging  such 
scientists  to remain there and from offering  them facilities  that could act as 
disincentives  to their return to their own country ；

2. DECIDES  that the World Health Assembly  and the Executive  Board shall monitor  and evaluate 
the effectiveness  of the Organization's  programmes  in biomedical  and health services  research, 
as well as policies  aiming to improve  the research  capabilities  of developing  countries； 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General 
(1) to strengthen  the global leadership  of the Organization  in the worldwide  coordination and steering  of research  necessary  for the attainment  of Health for All by the Year 
2000, by: , 
(a) intensifying  the coordinating  functions  of WHO and reinforcing  the actual 
implementation  of research  activities  by Member States and institutions  and 
individuals,  particularly  in developing  countries,  and utilizing,  inter alia，  the 
medium-term  programmes  for research  promotion  and development  to this end； 
(b) creating  and maintaining  within the Organization  at all levels and especially 
at the global level a blend of scientific  expertise  of highest  quality,  which should 
be at the disposal  of Member States in their efforts  to harness  research  to national 
strategies  for health development; 
(c) expanding  the involvement  of scientists  from developing  and developed  countries 
in the Organization1  s research  programmes  and utilizing  fully the Global and 
Regional  Advisory  Committees  on Medical  Research; 
(d) studying  the possibility  of setting  up mu11idiscip1inary  groups of experts  to 
evaluate  progress  in research  and to examine  ways and means of ensuring  the speedy 
application  of the results  within programmes  so.that  the benefits  facilitate  the 
attainment  of the target of health for all by the year 2000； 
(2) to cooperate  with Member States in carrying  out a thorough  assessment  of their 
current capabilities  and needs regarding  research  and in mobilizing  the intellectual  and 
material  resources  of the Organization  to improve  such capabilities  and meet needs； 
(3) to take vigorous  measures  to increase  extrabudgetary  support  for health research 
that is coordinated  or sponsored  by WHO and to concentrate  both the Organization's 
regular budget and its extrabudgetary  funds for research  on programmes  that are most 
relevant  for attaining  health for all by the year 2000； 
(4) to improve  the mechanisms  for the dissemination  of biomedical  and health services 
research  information； 
(5) to submit to the Thirty-fifth  World Health Assembly  a report on the progress 
achieved  in the implementation  of this resolution.
