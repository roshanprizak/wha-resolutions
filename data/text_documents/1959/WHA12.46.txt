The Twelfth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  that  the Executive  Board  called  the attention  of the World  Health  Assembly  to the fact  that 
establishment  of a multiplicity  of special  accounts  had  certain  disadvantages  from  an administrative  point 
of view;  1 
Having  considered  a report  by the Director-General  on the  present  status  of special  accounts;  and 
Believing  that  the establishment  of a single  fund  should  be the subject  of further  study, 
1. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to submit  to the Executive  Board  at its twenty-fifth  session  a further 
report  on the  amalgamation  of special  accounts  into  a single  fund;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  to study  this  matter  and  to submit  the results  of such  study,  together 
with  its recommendations,  to the  Thirteenth  World  Health  Assembly.
