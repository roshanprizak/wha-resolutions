WHA13.42  Headquarters  Accommodation  : Reimbursement  by the United  Nations 
The Thirteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that  at such  time  as the headquarters  of the World  Health  Organization  is transferred 
to its new  premises,  the space  which  it now  occupies  in the Palais  des Nations  will  no longer  be required 
for the  accommodation  of WHO; 
Considering  that,  should  the World  Health  Organization  release  these  premises  to the United  Nations 
prior  to the expiration  date  of the 99-years'  lease  held  by WHO,  the United  Nations  will  receive  valuable 
rights  ; 
Considering  that  the major  share  in the financing  of the cost  of the extension  of the Palais  des Nations 
(Sw.  fr. 4 425 763)  was  met  by the  generous  gift  to WHO  by the  Swiss  Confederation  of a sum 
of Sw.  fr. 3 000 000; 
Recalling  that  the sums  expended  by WHO  in the extension  of the Palais  des Nations  were  set aside 
for the express  purpose  of providing  accommodation  for WHO  and  that  it is reasonable  to expect  that 
these  sums  will  be reimbursed  to WHO,  in order  to cover  a part  of the costs  of the construction  of the new 
premises  and  to maintain  the purposes  for which  the grant  from  the Swiss  Government  was  given;  and 
Considering  that  the increase  in building  costs  and  other  factors  that  have  arisen  since  the extension 
of the Palais  des Nations  was  built  have  enhanced  the present  value  of these  premises  over  and  above  the 
original  costs  of construction, 
1. REQUESTS  the United  Nations  to give  full consideration  to the reimbursement  to WHO,  in consideration 
of its relinquishing  the premises  now  occupied  in the Palais  des Nations,  of a sum  representing  an equitable 
valuation  of the rights  so relinquished;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to transmit  this  resolution  to the  Secretary-General  of the  United 
Nations  for submission  to the United  Nations  General  Assembly.
