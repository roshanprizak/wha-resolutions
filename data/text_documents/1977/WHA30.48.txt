WHA30.48  The  role  of nursing/midwifery  personnel  in primary  health  care  teams 
The Thirtieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Bearing  in mind  resolution  WHA28.88  on the development  of primary  health  care; 
Reaffirming  the main  principles  contained  in resolution  WHA29.72  on health  manpower  development  ； 
Having  examined  the report  of the Director-General  on the work  of WHO  in 1976，and  noting  particularly  the  expressed  priority  to be given  to the  rapid  balanced  increase  in the numbers  of health  personnel 
and to the strengthening  of facilities  for this  purpose; 
Considering  that  comprehensive  primary  health  care  services  involve  not only  treatment  of the ill but also, 
and more  so, the prevention  of disease  as well  as the promotion  and  maintenance  of health  ； 
Considering  that  nursing/midwifery  personnel  as part  of the health  team  have  provided  and  continue  to 
provide  the greater  part  of health  care  in most  health  systems; 
Considering  that  many  Member  States  already  have  a sizeable  pool  of nursing/midwifery  personnel 
possessing  the necessary  managerial,  supervisory  and  teaching  skills  from  which  may  be drawn  teachers  and 
supervisors  of primary  health  care  workers  ； 
Considering  that  most  of the  primary  health  services,  particularly  in developing  countries,  are  in the 
field of maternal  and  child  health  care  and  family  planning,  in which  different  categories  of nursing/midwifery 
personnel  have  traditionally  been  the  primary  sources  of such  services,  under  the  general  supervision  of 
qualified  physicians; 
Considering  that  within  the  range  of nursing/midwifery  skills  and  knowledge  should  be the  ability  to 
plan  and  organize  with  individuals  and  communities  health  care  including  vaccination  programmes  as well 
as aspects  of self-care  enabling  them  to become  self-reliant; 
Recognizing  that  there  are  many  alternatives  that  may  be considered  in the  development  of primary 
health  care  workers,  one  cost-effective  alternative  being  the  redefinition  and  restructuring  of nursing/ 
midwifery  roles  and  functions  in relation  to those  of other  members  of the health  team,  in order  to optimize 
their  contribution  to primary  health  care,  including  the  implementation  of programmes  for  immunization 
of babies  and  infants  ； 
1. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  States: 
(1) undertake  a comprehensive  review  of the  roles  and  functions  of the  different  types  of personnel, 
including  nursing/midwifery  personnel,  within  the  context  of national  health  programmes,  particularly 
the aspects  relating  to health  teams  in primary  health  care,  to achieve  a satisfactory  balance  ； 
(2) redress  the  imbalance  in the production  and  utilization  of different  types  of health  manpower  in 
such  a way  that  a more  rational  increase  is effected  in the  supply  of the  different  types  of nursing/ 
midwifery  personnel,  to be developed  in harmony  with  that  of other  categories  of health  manpower 
so as to respond  to the pressing  needs  of primary  health  care,  including  vaccination  programmes  ； 
(3) utilize  more  effectively  existing  nursing/midwifery  personnel  by involving  them,  together  with  the 
representatives  of other  categories  of health  manpower,  in the planning  and  management  of primary 
health  care  and  vaccination  programmes  and  as teachers  and  supervisors  of primary  health  care  workers; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to cooperate  with  Member  States  in redefining  and  restructuring  the  roles  and  functions  of the 
different  categories  of nursing/midwifery  personnel  in the  health  team  so that  they  can  meet,  in an 
interdisciplinary  approach,  the needs  of communities  for primary  health  care  as part  of total  community 
development; 
(2) to intensify  efforts  to develop  retraining  and  continuing  education  programmes  for  nursing/ 
midwifery  personnel  consistent  with  the redefined  and  restructured  roles  and  functions  of the different 
members  of the health  team; 
(3) to provide  nursing/midwifery  personnel  with  the  opportunities  to develop  the  skills  required  to 
participate  effectively  in a multidisciplinary  approach  to the planning,  management  and  execution  of 
primary  health  care  and  vaccination  programmes; 
(4) to promote  the further  development  of appropriate  technologies,  studies,  research  and  experimentation; 
(5) to re-examine  and,  if necessary,  develop  within  the  structure  of WHO  the  mechanisms  through 
which  the  planning  and  implementation  of such  technical  cooperation  may  be effected  with  Member 
States; 
(6) to report  on the progress  made  to a future  Health  Assembly.
