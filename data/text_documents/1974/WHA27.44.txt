WHA27.44  Promotion  of national  health  services 
The Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  reviewed  the  Director-General's  Annual  Report1  for  1973，which  points  out  the  disparities 
between  the levels  of development  of the health  services  of the Member  States  owing  to the different  stages 
reached  in their  social  and  economic  development,  and  taking  into  account  the fifth  report  on the world  health 
situation  and  the discussions  to which  the review  of these  reports  depicting  the health  situation  at the national 
level  gave  rise; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA23.61,  WHA25.17,  WHA26.35  and  WHA26.43; 
Considering  that  the goals  and  objectives  of WHO  directed  towards  the improvement  and  protection 
of health  can be facilitated  through  the harmonious  development  of the health  services  ； 
Mindful  of the need  to concentrate  WHO'S  activities  in order  to ensure  that  they  produce  a continuing 
impact  on health  programmes; 
Taking  into  account  the experience  which  has  been  acquired  by some  Member  States  which  may  assist 
in the adoption  of methods  which  would  accelerate  the development  of the health  structures  and  systems  of 
other  Member  States, 
1. CONSIDERS  it necessary  to concentrate  WHO's  efforts  in order  to assist  governments  to direct  their  health 
service  programmes  towards  their  major  health  objectives,  with  priority  being  given  to the rapid  and  effective 
development  of the health  delivery  system  in the light  of the specific  economic  and  social  context  of each 
country,  and  at the same  time  to support  the continuous  training  and  instruction  of the necessary  national 
health  personnel;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to report  to the fifty-fifth  session  of the Executive  Board  and  the Twentyeighth  World  Health  Assembly  upon  the steps  which  could  be undertaken  by WHO  to further  the implementation  of this  and  the related  resolutions  referred  to above,  and  which  could  result  in more  effective  coordination  between  WHO's  activities  and  national  health  programmes.
