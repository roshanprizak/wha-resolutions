The Sixth World Health Assembly 1. NOTES with appreciation the consideration given by the Technical Assistance Committee to the subject of local costs tobe borne by governments ; 2. REAFFIRMS its belief that, in their practical applications, the decisions of the Technical Assistance Committee and the Economic and Social Council on this subject present serious obstacles to the acceptance of Technical Assistance by the countries where the greatest need exists ; 3. NOTES that these decisions do not fully meet the request of the World Health Assembly in resolution WHA5.59 and of the Executive Board in resolution EB11.R57.5 ; and, further, 4. NOTES that one of the criteria for the participation of governments in local costs, as defined in resolution No. 4 of the Technical Assistance Committee on the subject of local costs (adopted by the committee at its 27th meeting) is as follows : " That requesting governments should not be required to provide the cost of lodging or travel per diem for experts in respect of such projects and programmes for the imple-mentation of which extensive staff and other facilities are provided by the requesting governments... " ; 5. SUGGESTS that the position should be reviewed after a year by the Technical Assistance Committee and the Economic and Social Council in the light of the experience gained ; and 6. REQUESTS the Director-General to invite the attention of the Technical Assistance Committee and the Economic and Social Council to any difficulties that maybe experienced by this Organization in the implementation of this policy and to report to the Seventh World Health Assembly. (Fourth report of the Committee on Administration, Finance and Legal Matters, adopted at the tenth plenary meeting, 22 May 1953)
