RESEARCH  ON AGING 
The Fortieth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA32.25  and WHA35.28  on health care of the elderly; 
Noting the recommendation  of the Advisory  Committee  on Health Research  on the 
establishment  of an international  research  programme  on aging; 
Believing  that the attainment  of health for all will result in the survival  of 
increasing  numbers  of the world's  population  into old age; 
Realizing  that greater  knowledge  is required  to understand  both the determinants  of 
healthy aging and how to apply this knowledge  optimally  with a view to adding healthy  life to 
years; 
Considering  that research  on aging and research  training  need to be extended  to the 
countries  in which most elderly  people will be living in the year 2000; 
REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to establish  an international  research  programme  on aging, as an integral  part of 
the Organization1s  programme  on health of the elderly; 
(2) to secure the cooperation  of interested  governments,  voluntary  organizations, 
foundations,  private  donors and other bodies in raising  the extrabudgetary  funds, in 
addition  to the WHO support  to the research  programme  within its existing  budgetary 
provisions,  for establishing,  implementing  and monitoring  the programme.
