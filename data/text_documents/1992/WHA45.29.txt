PROPOSED  GUIDELINES  ON THE  WHO  CERTIFICATION  SCHEME 
ON THE  QUALITY  OF PHARMACEUTICAL  PRODUCTS  MOVING  IN 
INTERNATIONAL  COMMERCE 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Taking  note of previous  resolutions  on WHO，s  Certification  Scheme  on the Quality  of Pharmaceutical 
Products  moving  in International  Commerce,  and particularly  resolution  WHA41.16,  which  refers  to the export, 
import  and smuggling  of falsely  labelled,  spurious,  counterfeited  or substandard  pharmaceutical  preparations; 
Having  reviewed  the report  on the implementation  of WHO，s  revised  drug  strategy,  and in particular  the 
proposed  guidelines  on the implementation  of the Certification  Scheme; 
Aware  of the need  for prospective  importing  countries  to obtain  explicit  assurances  regarding  the quality 
of products  not registered  in the country  of provenance; 
Believing  that the adoption  of the proposed  guidelines  will contribute  to deterrence  of the export,  import 
and smuggling  of falsely  labelled,  spurious,  counterfeited  or substandard  pharmaceutical  preparations; 
Recognizing  that a comprehensive  system  of quality  assurance  including  the WHO  Certification  Scheme 
must be founded  on a reliable  national  system  of licensing,  independent  analysis  of the finished  product  and 
independent  inspection  to verify  that all manufacturing  operations  are carried  out in conformity  with accepted 
norms,  referred  to as "good  manufacturing  practices", 
1. ENDORSES  the guidelines  for implementation  of the WHO  Certification  Scheme,  which  will be 
evaluated  and revised,  as necessary,  in consultation  with the Committee  on Drug  Policies  of the Executive 
Board; 
2. URGES  Member  States  to implement  these  guidelines,  and to issue  certificates  within  five years  in a 
form to be agreed  in the light of experience  gained  in preliminary  field testing.
