Agenda item 12.20 24 May 2007 
REISSUED FOR TECHNICAL REASONS 
Public health, innovation and intellectual property 
 
The Sixtieth World Health Assembly, 
Recalling resolution WHA59.24, creating an interg overnmental working group with the purpose 
of elaborating a draft global strategy and plan of ac tion to provide a medium-term framework based on 
the recommendations of the Commission on Intellectu al Property, Innovation and Public Health, and 
to secure, inter alia, an enhanced and sustainable ba sis for needs-driven, essential health research and 
development relevant to diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries, proposing clear objectives and priorities for research and development, and estimating funding needs in this area;  
Concerned that communicable diseases account for approximately 50% of the burden of disease 
in developing countries, and that access to medicines, vaccines and diagnostic kits is hampered by, 
inter alia, inadequate health-care systems, lack of resources and prices that are beyond the reach of 
many in the developing world;  
Conscious of the growing burden of disease and conditions that disproportionately affect 
developing countries, particularly those affecting women and children, including an upsurge in noncommunicable diseases; 
Noting that the Doha Ministerial Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health 
confirms that the Agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to 
protect public health; 
Noting that intellectual property rights are an important incentive for the development of new 
health-care products; 
Welcoming with enthusiasm the commitment of the Director-General to the process 
spearheaded by the Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual 
Property, 
1. EXPRESSES appreciation to the Director-General for her commitment and encourages her to 
guide the process to draw up a global strategy and plan of action that will provide a medium-term framework for needs-driven essential health research and development; 
2. URGES Member States to support fully and actively the Intergovernmental Working Group 
process and provide adequate resources to WHO; WHA60.30 
 
  
 
 
 
2 3. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to ensure technical and financial support to the Intergovernmental Working Group in 
order to facilitate completion of its tasks in time for its report to the Sixty-first World Health 
Assembly;  
(2) to provide as appropriate, upon request, in collaboration with other competent 
international organizations, technical and policy support to countries that intend to make use of 
the flexibilities contained in the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights and other international agreements in order to promote access to pharmaceutical 
products,1 and to implement the Doha Ministerial Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and 
Public Health and other WTO instruments; 
(3) to provide technical and financial support for regional consultative meetings in order to 
set regional priorities that will inform the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group;  
(4) to encourage the development of proposals for health-needs driven research and 
development for discussion at the Intergovernmental Working Group that includes a range of 
incentive mechanisms including also addressing the linkage between  the cost of research and 
development and  the price of medicines, vaccines, diagnostic kits  and other health-care products 
and a method for tailoring the optimal mix of incentives to a particular condition or product, 
with the objective of addressing diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries; 
(5) to prepare background documents on each of the eight proposed elements of the plan of 
action, as identified by the Intergovernmental Working Group, including: 
• a matrix on ongoing activities and current gaps; 
 a matrix on current proposals referring to key stakeholders; 
 the financial implications of those proposals.

1 The WTO General Council in its Decision of 30 August 2003 on Implementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha 
Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health decided that “pharmaceutical pr oduct” means any patented product, 
or products manufactured through a patented process, of the pharmaceutical sector needed to address the public health problems as recognized in paragraph 1 of the Declaration. It is understood that active ingredients necessary for its 
manufacture and diagnostic kits needed for its use would be included.
