RESOLUTIONS 
WHA59.1 Eradication of poliomyelitis 
The Fifty-ninth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on eradication of poliomyelitis; 1 
Recalling the 2004 Geneva Declaration for the Eradication of Poliomyelitis, committing the six 
countries in which poliomyelitis is endemic and spearheading partners to interrupting the final chains 
of poliovirus transmission through intens ified poliomyelitis immunization campaigns; 
Recognizing that the occurrence of poliomyelitis is increasingly rare due to the intensification of 
poliomyelitis eradication activities globally, and that all Member States are enhancing surveillance for 
the detection of circulating polioviruses and are in the process of implementing biocontainment activities; 
Noting the significant support extended by partners, appreciating their ongoing cooperation, and 
calling for their continuing support to national programmes in the final phase of the global eradication 
effort; 
Noting with concern that there is a substantial unmet funding requirement of US$ 485 million 
for planned activities during the mop-up and certification phase between 2006 and 2008; 
Noting that most of the new cases in 2005 have come from areas where transmission of 
indigenous polioviruses had already been stopped; 
Noting that poliovirus importations into poliomyelitis-free areas constitute potential 
international health threats; 
Noting the importance of high-quality surveillance systems in countries where poliomyelitis has 
been eradicated; 
Recalling the standing recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Poliomyelitis 
Eradication,

1. URGES Member States in which poliomyelitis is endemic to act on their commitment to 
interrupting transmission of wild-type poliovirus th rough the administration of appropriate monovalent 
oral poliomyelitis vaccines;

2. URGES all poliomyelitis-free Member States to respond rapidly to the detection of circulating 
polioviruses by: 
(1) conducting an initial investigation, activating local responses and, when necessary, 
requesting international expert risk-assessment within 72 hours of confirmation of the index 
case in order to establish an emergency plan of action; 
(2) implementing a minimum of three large-scale rounds of immunization using a typespecific monovalent oral poliomyelitis vaccine, or another composition of vaccine if 
appropriate, including, where applicable, house-to-house vaccination, the first round to be 
conducted within four weeks of confirmation of th e index case, with an interval of four weeks 
between subsequent rounds; 
(3) targeting all children aged less than five ye ars in the affected and adjacent geographical 
areas, or a minimum of two million to five million children in large population countries, using 
independent monitoring to determine whether at least 95% immunization coverage has been reached; 
(4) ensuring that at least two full rounds of poliomyelitis immunization are conducted in the 
targeted area after the most recent detection of poliovirus; 
(5) enhancing surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis to a level of greater than two cases per 
100 000 children aged less than 15 years, for the duration of the outbreak and at least 12 months 
immediately thereafter; 
(6) sustaining high routine immunization coverage, of at least 80%, with oral poliomyelitis 
vaccine, and highly sensitive disease surveillance; 
3. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to ensure the availability of technical expertise to support Member States in their planning 
and emergency response related to an outbreak; 
(2) to assist in mobilizing funds to implement emergency response to an outbreak and to 
ensure adequate supplies of monovalent oral poliomyelitis vaccine; 
(3) to advise at-risk Member States, on the basis of each risk assessment, on which, if any, 
additional measures are required nationally and internationally to reduce the further spread of 
poliovirus, taking into account the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on 
Poliomyelitis Eradication; 
(4) to continue to prepare for other potential risks to poliomyelitis eradication and a 
poliomyelitis-free world in the short and longer term, and to propose a mechanism for their 
management to the Executive Board at its 119th session; 
(5) to report to the Executive Board at its 119th session on progress made in the 
implementation of this resolution.
