The Forty-sixth World Health Assembly, Noting with concern that, as at 31 December 1992: (a) the rate of collection in 1992 of contributions to the effective working budget amounted to 77.60%, leaving US$ 79 599 485 of 1992 contributions unpaid; (b) only 87 Members had paid their 1992 contributions to the effective working budget in full, and 66 Members had made no payment; 1. EXPRESSES concern at the level of outstanding contributions, which has had a deleterious effect on programmes and on the financial situation; 2. CALLS THE ATTENTION of all Members to Financial Regulation 5.6, which provides that instalments of contributions and advances shall be considered as due and payable in full by the first day of the year to which they relate, and to the importance of paying contributions as early as possible to enable the DirectorGeneral to implement the programme budget in an orderly manner; 3. REMINDS Members that, as a result of the adoption, by resolution WHA41.12, of an incentive scheme to promote the timely payment of assessed contributions, those that pay their assessed contributions early in the year in which they are due will have their contributions payable fora subsequent programme budget reduced appreciably, whereas those paying later will have their contributions payable for that subsequent programme budget reduced only marginafly or not at all; 4. URGES Members that are regularly late in the payment of their contributions to take as rapidly as possible all steps necessary to ensure prompt and regular payment; 5. REQUESTS the Director-General to review the implications of an increase in the level of the Working Capital Fund and to report to the Executive Board on this matter at the ninety-third session; 6. FURTHER REQUESTS the Director-General to draw this resolution to the attention of all Members. Eleventh plenary meeting, 10 May 1993 A46 / VR / 11 I
