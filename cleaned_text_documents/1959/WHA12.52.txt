The Twelfth World Health Assembly, I. Having examined the report of the Director-General on co-operation with the United Nations and specialized agencies and their decisions affecting the work of the World Health Organization, NOTES this report; II. Considering resolution 1320 (XIII) adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the subject of rosters of scientific and technical personnel of the less developed countries;3 Believing that, at all events in the sphere of competence of WHO, the preparation and keeping up to date of such rosters would meet with considerable practical difficulties and require much time and heavy expenditure; and Noting that, in the sphere of health, the regional offices of WHO keep themselves continually aware of the existence of scientific and technical personnel whose services might be utilized outside their respective countries, 1. BELIEVES that, in the sphere of health, the advantages tobe derived from such rosters would not counterbalance the considerable difficulties and the expenditure involved in preparing them and keeping them up to date; and 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to present these views to the Economic and Social Council at its twenty-eighth session. Eleventh plenary meeting, 28 May 1959 (section 5 of the fourth report of the Committee on Programme and Budget)
