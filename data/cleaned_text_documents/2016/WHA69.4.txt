d The Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report on the role of the health sector in the sound management of chemicals;1 Recalling resolution WHA59.15 (2006), in which the Health Assembly welcomed the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management adopted by the International Conference on Chemicals Management (Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 4 6 February 2006) with its overall objective to achieve the sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle sot hat, by 2020, chemicals are used and produced in ways that lead to the minimization of significant adverse effects on human health and the environment, as inspired by paragraph 23 of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August 4 September 2002); Reaffirming its commitment to the outcome document of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), entitled The future we want;2 Further recalling paragraph 213 of the outcome document The future we want, which states that [w]e reaffirm our aim to achieve, by 2020, the sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle and of hazardous waste in ways that lead to minimization of significant adverse effects on human health and the environment, setout in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation; Recalling also, paragraph 214 of The future we want, which calls for the effective implementation and strengthening of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management as part of a robust, coherent, effective and efficient system for the sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle; Noting the limited time remaining to make progress toward the 2020 goal, and the urgent need for practical action and technical cooperation within the health sector, aswell as with other sectors; Acknowledging that chemicals contribute significantly to the global economy, living standards and health but that unsound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle contributes 1 Document A69 / 19. 2 United Nations General Assembly resolution 66 / 288, Annex. WHA6 9.4 2 significantly to the global burden of disease, and that much of this burden is borne by developing countries; Noting that annually 12.6 million deaths (22.7% of all deaths) and 596 million disability adjusted life years (21.8% of all disease burden in disability-adjusted life years) are thought tobe linked to modifiable environmental factors, including chemical exposures, and that in 2012 1.3 million deaths (2.3% of all deaths) and 43 million disability-adjusted life years (1. 6% of all disease burden in disability-adjusted life years) were attributable to exposures toa number of selected chemicals;1 noting also that, among these, addressing lead exposure would prevent 9.8% of intellectual disability, 4% of ischaemic heart disease and 4.6% of stroke in the population; and that unintentional poisonings killed an estimated 193 000 people in 2012, 85% in developing countries where such poisonings are strongly associated with excessive exposure to, and inappropriate use of, toxic ch emicals; and recognizing that due to the complex nature of the issue, disease burden information is only available fora very small number of chemical exposures and that people are exposed to many more chemicals in their daily lives; Concerned about acute, chronic and combined adverse effects that can result from exposure to chemicals and waste, and that the risks are often unequally distributed and can be more significant for some vulnerable populations, especially women, children, and, through them, future generations; Underlining the need to address the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health to improve health outcomes and achieve sustainable development; Underscoring the importance of protecting health and reducing health inequities, including by the reduction of adverse health impacts from chemicals and waste, by adopting health-in-all policies and whole-of-government approaches, as appropriate; Recalling WHOs longstanding recognition of the importance of sound chemicals management for human health, the key role of WHO in providing leadership on the human health aspects of the sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle, and the necessity of health sector participation in, and contribution to, these efforts setout in resolution WHA59.15 (2006) on the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management; resolution WHA63.25 (2010) on improvement of health through safe and environmentally sound waste management; resolution WHA63.26 on improvement of health through sound management of obsolete pesticides and other obsolete chemicals; resolution WHA67.11 (2014) on public health impacts of exposure to mercury and mercury compounds; and resolution WHA68.8 (2015) on health and the environment: addressing the health impact of air pollution; Recalling further the health-related outcomes of the second, third and fourth sessions of the International Conference on Chemicals Management, which drew attention to the need for greater involvement of the health sector and resulted in the adoption of a strategy for strengthening engagement of the health sector in the implementation of the Strategic Approach which details the key roles and responsibilities of the health sector in sound chemicals management; 1 Prss-Ustn A, et al.
