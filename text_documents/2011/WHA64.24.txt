Agenda item 13.15 24 May 2011 
Drinking-Water, Sanitation and Health 
 
The Sixty-fourth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on strategies for the safe management of drinking-water for human 
consumption;1 
Recalling the Declaration of Alma-Ata on Primar y Health Care and the various resolutions 
stressing the role of improving safe drinking-water, sanitation facilities and hygiene practices in 
primary health care, environmental health, preventio n of waterborne diseases, protection of high-risk 
communities, infant and young child nutrition, including resolutions WHA39.20, WHA42.25, 
WHA44.28, WHA45.31, WHA35.17, WHA51.28 and WHA63.23, as well as resolutions EB128.R7 
and EB128.R6 containing respectively draft resolu tions on cholera: mechanisms for control and 
prevention, and on eradication of dracunculiasis; 
Recalling further target C of Goal 7 (Ensure environmental sustainability) of the Millennium 
Development Goals, which calls for reducing by  half the proportion of the population without 
sustainable access to safe drinking-water and b asic sanitation by 2015, and the importance of this 
target for the achievement of other Goals, particul arly Goals 4 (Reduce child mortality), 5 (Improve 
maternal health) and 6 (Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases);2 
Recognizing that between 1990 and 2008 an estim ated 1.77 billion people gained access to 
improved sources of drinking-water and 1.26 billion ga ined access to improved sanitation, but deeply 
concerned that by the end of 2008, 884 million pe ople still lacked access to improved water sources 
and over 2.6 billion people did not have access to improved sanitation; 
Noting the multiple health benefits and economic advantages of a broad public health approach 
through the expansion of access to safe dri nking-water and sanitation, integrating household 
interventions, a more effective use of resources and th e early incorporation of health considerations in 
the planning and design of water resources developm ent, and recognizing the importance of pursuing 
these issues for the achievement of strategic obj ective 8 of the Medium-term strategic plan  
2008–2013; 
Recalling the International Decade for Action, “W ater for Life” 2005–2015, proclaimed by the 
United Nations General Assembly in resolution 58/ 217; the International Year of Sanitation, 2008, 
declared in resolution 61/192; as well as the fo llow-up resolution 65/153, ca lling upon all Member

2 States to support the global effort to realize “Sus tainable sanitation: the five-year-drive to 2015”; and 
also recalling that water quality was the theme of the United Nations World Water Day 2010; 
Recalling further the United Nations General A ssembly resolution 64/292, which recognizes the 
right to safe and clean drinking-water and sanitation as a “human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights” and the Human Rights Council resolution (A/HRC/RES/15/9) 
affirming that the “human right to safe drinking-w ater and sanitation is derived from the right to an 
adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, as well as the right to life and human dignity”; 
Noting with interest the efforts made to impr ove access to safe drinking-water, basic sanitation 
and to promote good personal and domestic hygiene pr actices that contribute to a sustainable approach 
to fight sanitation- and water-related diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea, which claimed the lives 
of 2.5 million people in 2008, among which 1. 3 million children under the age of five; 
Also noting the water, sanitation and hygiene components in the seven-point strategy agreed by 
WHO and UNICEF for comprehensive diarrhoea c ontrol, which include the promotion of hand 
washing with soap, household water treatment and safe storage and community-wide sanitation 
promotion; 
Noting that millions of people are exposed to da ngerous levels of biological contaminants and 
chemical pollutants in their drinking-water partly due to inadequate management of urban, industrial 
or agricultural wastewater; 
Recognizing WHO’s major normative role in issu es of water and health, its key role in 
monitoring progress regarding water supply an d sanitation as well as its promotional and 
capacity-building roles for Water Safety Plans, Sani tation Safety Plans, water and sanitation in health 
care, schools and other public buildings and se ttings, and safe management of medical waste; 
Noting that global driving forces, including population growth, urba nization and climate 
change, are expected to affect significantly th e availability and quality of access to water and 
sanitation services and of freshwater resources and the need for water resources development for other 
purposes, which in themselves carry potential health risks, and noti ng that a response to these trends 
requires an intersectoral approach mainstreaming h ealth and environmental issues in national sectoral 
policies through integrated water resources manage ment and strengthened in stitutional arrangements 
to prevent and reduce the incidence of  sanitation- and water-related diseases; 
Noting that over the last decade almost two b illion people were victims of natural disasters, 
including floods and droughts, that act as key cont ributors to sanitation- and water-related diseases; 
also recognizing the need, in emergency situations, to develop prevention tools and specific actions for 
supplying drinking-water and sanitation as well as the l eading role of both WHO in the Health cluster 
and UNICEF in the Nutrition and WASH (Water, Sa nitation and Hygiene) clusters in emergency 
operations, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to develop and strengthen, with all stakehol ders, national public health strategies, so that 
they highlight the importance of safe drinking- water, sanitation and hygiene as the basis for 
primary prevention, based on an integrated appr oach of sectoral planning processes, policies, 
programmes and projects regarding water and sanitation, guided by an effective interministerial   WHA64.24

management of small-community water supplies) and associations in official relations with 
WHO; WHA64.24 
 
 
  
 
 
4 2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to continue calling the attention of the in ternational community and decision-makers to 
the importance of primary prevention as a key goal, and the major impact of safe drinkingwater, sanitation and hygiene on global public h ealth, national economies, and the achievement 
of the Millennium Development Goals; 
(2) to formulate a new, integrated WHO strate gy for water, sanitation and health including a 
specific focus on water quality and monitoring issues, and on promotion of sanitation and

encouraging the establishment of preventative me asures as well as rapid analysis techniques to 
guarantee the quality of drinking-water and avoid adverse health impacts of water resources 
development; 
(3) to strengthen WHO’s collaboration with all relevant UN-Water members and partners, as 
well as other relevant organizations promoti ng access to safe drinking-water, sanitation and 
hygiene services, so as to set an example of ef fective intersectoral action in the context of

indicators, including water quality and other re levant parameters at  appropriate levels; 
(5) to continue supporting existing regional in itiatives such as the United Nations Economic 
Commission for Europe’s Protocol on Water and Hea lth which is an instrument of reference for 
safe water management and the protection of human health and encourage the creation of 
similar instruments dedicated to sustainable wa ter management and reduction of sanitation- and 
water-related diseases in other regions, as well as  continue to encourage relevant regional 
initiatives such as the WHO/UNEP Libreville Declar ation on Health and Environment (2010) or 
the WHO Parma Declaration on Environment and Health (2010); 
(6) to develop, in coordination with bilate ral and multilateral partners, Member States’

Statistics, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring  Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation 
and the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assess ment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water; 
(8) to increase technical assi stance to countries by facilitating training and adult learning 
programmes for staff in charge of maintaining catchments, treatment and distribution facilities, 
water and sanitation ne tworks and for staff and laborator ies in charge of water quality
