Geneva: World Health Organization; 2019 (https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/325293, accessed 4 January 2021).  RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 33     Recognizing that approximately 25% of epilepsy cases and a significant proportion of other neurological disorders could be prevented if broader public health actions were taken to strengthen maternal and newborn health care, ensure effective noncommunicable disease control (including promotion of cerebrovascular health and prevention of traumatic brain injuries, as well as prevention of central nervous system infections), and to expand scientific research and training of health professionals; Acknowledging the importance of addressing the preventable causes of epilepsy and other neurological disorders, including by: promoting healthy brain development and functioning over the life course;1 the control of neurocysticercosis and its association with epilepsy;2 the provision of safe environments to avoid traumatic injuries due to accidents, violence or exposure to environmental pollutants;2 and access to medicines to prevent neurological infections, such as tetanus, rabies, HIV-associated neurological disorders and cerebral malaria;3 Recognizing that epilepsy and other neurological disorders often co-exist and can be compounded by other health conditions, that epilepsy, for example, can occur following stroke and traumatic brain injury, that neurological disorders, including epilepsy, are commonly associated with infections such as malaria and meningitis, and that among people with intellectual disabilities one in four also lives with epilepsy; and noting that the WHO global disability action plan 2014–2021 and WHO’s global action plan on the public health response to dementia 2017–2025 provide useful frameworks for taking a synergistic and complementary approach to tackling some of these co-existing conditions; Noting with concern the significant mental health impact of neurological disorders on affected persons and their families and recalling, therefore, the importance of resolution WHA66.8 (2013), through which the Health Assembly adopted the comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2020; Recalling United Nations General Assembly resolution 70/1 (2015) entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development entitled “The future we want”,4 and the report of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals,5 established pursuant to United Nations General Assembly resolution 66/288 (2012), which includes Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) and target 3.4 (By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being); Recalling also that in order to promote physical and mental health and well-being, and to extend life expectancy for all, we must achieve universal health coverage; Recalling further that we are committed to the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases, including behavioural, developmental and neurological disorders, which constitute a major challenge for sustainable development;  1 See resolution WHA67.10 (2014) on the newborn health action plan; and resolution WHA57.17 (2004) on the global strategy on diet, physical activity and health. 2 See Accelerating work to overcome the global impact of neglected tropical diseases: a roadmap for implementation.
