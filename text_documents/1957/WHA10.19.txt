WHA10.19  WHO  Participation  in the Expanded  Programme  of Technical  Assistance 
The Tenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  studied  the  report  of the  Director-General  on  the  Expanded  Programme  of Technical 
Assistance  for 1958,1  as well  as resolutions  EB19.R45,  EB19.R46,  EB19.R47  and  EB19.R48  adopted  by 
the Executive  Board  at its nineteenth  session, 
1. CONCURS  in the opinions  expressed  by the Executive  Board  in those  resolutions; 
2. EXPRESSES  its satisfaction  at the improved  financial  stability  of the Programme  and  the  fact  that  the 
earmarking  for WHO-assisted  projects  for 1957  at the beginning  of the year  was  equal  to the Category  I 
approved  Programme,  except  for a part  of the  projects  planned  for  financing  from  currencies  requiring 
management  ; 
3. URGES  Members  to emphasize  the priority  of health  projects  in their  1958  country  programme  requests 
as an essential  factor  in the social  and  economic  development  of countries  ; 
4. RECOGNIZES  that  the  ten  per  cent,  limitation  for  regional  or inter-country  projects  placed  by the 
Technical  Assistance  Committee  on the planning  figure  for projects  is detrimental  to assistance  to governments  in the health  field  when  such  assistance  can  best  take  the form  of a programme  serving  a group  of 
countries,  as stated  in the Second  General  Programme  of Work;  2 
5. NOTES  with  satisfaction  that  the  Technical  Assistance  Committee  intends  to make  a full  study  of 
regional  projects  at its session  in the summer  of 1957  and  will  reconsider  the  policy  concerning  the  percentage  for regional  projects  for future  years; 
6. CALLS  THE  ATTENTION  of Members  to the  requirements  for  their  central  co-ordinating  authority  to 
give active  support  to regional  projects  in the  Technical  Assistance  Programme  in which  they  wish  to 
participate  in 1958  and  future  years.
