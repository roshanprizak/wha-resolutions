Agenda item 14.6 26 May 20 15 
Health and the environment: addressing the health 
impact of air pollution  
 
The Sixty -eighth World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on health and the environment: addressing the health impact of air 
pollution ;1 
Reaffirming its commitment to the outcome document of the Rio+20 Conference “The future 
we want”,  in which all States Members of the Unite d Nations committed to promoting sustainable 
development policies that support healthy air quality in the context of sustainable cities and human 
settlements, and recognized that reducing air pollution leads to positive effects on health;2 
Noting with deep  concern that indoor and outdoor air pollution are both among the leading 
avoidable causes of disease and death globally, and the world’s largest single environmental health risk;3 
Acknowledging that 4.3 million deaths occur each year from exposure to hous ehold (indoor) air 
pollution and that 3.7 million deaths each year are attributable to ambient (outdoor) air pollution, at a 
high cost to societies;4 
Aware that exposure to air pollutants, including fine particulate matter, is a leading risk factor 
for non communicable diseases in adults, including ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, asthma and cancer, and poses a considerable health threat to current and future 
generations;  
Concerned that half the deaths due to acute lowe r respiratory infections, including pneumonia in 
children aged less than five years, may be attributed to household air pollution, making it a leading 
risk factor for childhood mortality;

2 Further concerned that air pollution, including fine particulate mat ter, is classified as a cause of 
lung cancer by WHO’s International Agency on Research for Cancer ;1 
Aware that both short - and long -term exposure to air pollution has a negative impact on public 
health, with a much greater impact resulting from long -term e xposure and exposure at high levels, 
causing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, including chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and also that for many pollutants, such as particles, long -term exposure 
even at low le vels (below WHO air quality guidelines proposed levels) could result in some adverse 
health effects;  
Noting the strong significance of air pollution and its health effects for the objectives and targets 
contained in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Preve ntion and Control of Noncommunicable 
Diseases 2013 –2020, as well as the significance of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control, in particular Article 8 and its Guidelines  related to the protection from exposure to tobacco 
smoke, as applicable to t he parties of the Convention;  
Noting that air pollution is a cause of global health inequities, affecting in particular women, 
children and old persons, as well as low -income populations who are often exposed to high levels of 
ambient air pollution, or liv e in homes that have no other choice than to be exposed to air pollution 
from cooking and heating, and that improving air quality is among the measures with the greatest 
potential impact on health equity;2 
Cognizant that most air pollutants are emitted as a result of the human activities identified as 
sources of air pollution3 in the WHO guidelines on ambient and indoor air pollution, and that there are 
also naturally occurring phenomena that negatively affect air quality,4 and noting that there is a 
signif icant interrelation between outdoor and indoor air quality;  
Aware that promoting energy efficiency and expanding the use of clean and renewable energy 
can have co -benefits for health and sustainable development and stressing that the affordability of this 
energy will help maximize these opportunities;  
Underscoring that the root causes of air pollution and its adverse impacts are predominantly 
socioeconomic in nature, and cognizant of the need to address the social determinants of health related 
to developme nt in urban and rural settings, including poverty eradication, as an indispensable element 
for sustainable development and for the reduction of the health impact of air pollution;  
Emphasizing the importance of promotion, transfer and diffusion of environme ntally sound 
technologies, particularly to developing countries, to address the health impact of air pollution;

• Outdoor Air Pollution (2013, Volume 109);  
• Diesel and gasoline exhausts and some nitroarenes (2012, Volume 105);  
• Household use of solid fuels and high -temperature  frying (2010, Volume 95);  
• Indoor emissions from household combustion of coal (2012, Volume 100E);  
• Tobacco smoke and involuntary smoking (2004, Volume 83).

combustion; WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality: select pollutants; WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: Dampness and 
Mould.

  3 Acknowledging recent global efforts to promote air quality, in particular the 2014  United 
Nations Environment Assembly resolution on air quality , as well as the many national and regional 
initiatives to mitigate the health impacts of indoor and outdoor air pollution, and noting that regional 
and subregional cooperation frameworks provide good opportunities to address air quality issues 
according t o the specific circumstances of each region;  
Recognizing that in order to contribute to national policy choices that protect health and reduce 
health inequities, the health sector will need to engage in cross -sectoral approaches to health, including 
adopti ng a health -in-all policies approach;1 
Noting that WHO’s air quality guidelines for both ambient air quality2 (2005) and indoor air 
quality3 (2014) provide guidance and recommendations for clean air that protect human health, and 
recognizing that these nee d to be supported by activities, such as the promotion and facilitation of 
implementation;  
Acknowledging that while many of the most important and cost -effective actions against 
outdoor and indoor air pollution require the involvement and leadership of nat ional governments as 
well as regional and local authorities, cities are both particularly affected by the consequences of air 
pollution and well -placed to promote healthy city activities to reduce air pollution and its associated 
health impacts, and can de velop good practices, complement and implement national measures;  
Acknowledging that mobilizing national and, as appropriate, international resources is important 
for re -tooling relevant infrastructure that contributes to air pollution reduction is an inte gral element of 
global sustainable development, and that air pollution -related health impacts can be a health -relevant 
indicator for sustainable development policies;  
Aware that promoting air quality is a priority to protect health and provide co -benefits for the 
climate, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and food security;4 
Acknowledging also the complexity between improving air quality and reducing emissions of 
warming climate -altering pollutants, and that there can be meaning ful opportunities to achieve 
co-benefits resulting from these actions;  
Underlining that higher temperatures, heatwaves, dust - and sandstorms, volcanic eruptions and 
forest fires can also exacerbate the impact of anthropogenic air pollution on health,
