FIFTY-SECOND WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA52.22
Agenda item 13 25 May 1999
Poliomyelitis eradication
The Fifty-second World Health Assembly,
Reaffirming WHO’s commitment to the global eradication of poliomyelitis by the end of the year 2000;
Recog nizing  that substantial progress has been made towards eradication of poliomyelitis, with larg e
geogr aphic areas of the world now free of the disease, and a fall of 85% in annually reported cases since global
eradication began in 1988;
Noting  that, as of May 1999, poliomyelitis remains endemic in a number of countries of southern an d
western Asia and the African continent, some of which are either affected by conflict or constitute densel y
populated wild poliovirus “reservoirs”;
Realizing that civil strife and funding shortfalls represent the two majo r obstacles to achieving poliomyelitis
eradication;
Affirming that poliomyelitis eradication will have humanitarian and economic benefits for all countries,
1. URGES poliomyelitis-endemic Member States to acce lerate eradication activities by conducting additional
immunization  rounds each year, on either a national or subnational basis;  to improve the quality of nationa l
immuniz ation  days by ensuring that every child is reached;  to implement house-to-house “mopping-up ”
campaig ns;  and to enhance surveillance by ensuring that all cases of acute flaccid paralysis are detected an d
promptly investigated;
2. URGES poliomyelitis-free Member States:
(1) to sustain high levels of immunization coverage until eradication is certified globally;
(2) to maintain high quality surveillance for importation of wild poliovirus and establish action plans
for rapidly responding to such events;
3. URGES all Member States:WHA52.22
2(1) to mobilize th e human and financial resources necessary to accelerate eradication in poliomyelitisendemic countries;
(2) to support the peace-building process by facilitating ceasefires for national immunization days in
countries affected by conflict;
(3) to support the work of the poliomyelitis eradication initiative in strengthening health systems and
services;
(4) to begin, in  collaboration with WHO, the process leading to the laboratory containment of wil d
poliovirus in maximum containment laboratories;
4. REQUESTS the Director-General:
(1) to urge all partners to facilitate acceleration of the initiative to eradicate poliomyelitis during th e
critical period 1999 to 2001;
(2) to facilit ate, when necessary, coordinated mass immunization activities in bordering areas o f
Member States and WHO regions;
(3) to collaborate with other or ganizations of the United Nations system and other international bodies
in arrangi ng ceasefires for poliomyelitis eradication and facilitating eradication activities in countrie s
affected by conflict;
(4) to help mobilize the necessary financing to implement  eradication activities, including establishment
of an emergency fund to meet the needs of coun tries affected by conflict, countries classified as major wild
polio virus  reservoirs, and other countries in particularly difficult circumstances, and to draw upon th e
strengths of the regional offices in the use of these resources;
(5) to collaborate wit h Member States in the establishment of a mechanism for overseeing the process
of laboratory containment of wild poliovirus in maximum containment laboratories;
(6) to facilitate ongoing research to define the optimum strategy for eventually stopping immunization
against poliomyelitis.
