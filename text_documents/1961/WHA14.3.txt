The Fourteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the  Director-General  on the  status  of collection  of contributions 
and of advances  to the  Working  Capital  Fund  as at 31 December  1960; 
Noting  with  satisfaction  the collection  of contributions  in respect  of the 1960  budget  and  of advances 
to the  Working  Capital  Fund; 
Noting  that  three  Members,  Bolivia,  Uruguay  and  Yemen,  were  in arrears  for  amounts  which  equal 
or exceed  their  contribution  for  the  preceding  two  full  years;  and 
Having  carefully  considered  the  provisions  of Article  7 of the  Constitution  and  the  provisions  of 
paragraph  2 of resolution  WHA8.13  relating  to the  suspension  of voting  privileges, 
1. CALLS  THE  ATTENTION  of Member  governments  to the  importance  of paying  their  contributions  as 
early  as possible  in the  Organization's  financial  year; 
2. REQUESTS  Member  governments  that  have  not done  so to provide  in their  national  budgets  for regular 
payment  to the  World  Health  Organization  of their  annual  contributions;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to communicate  with  the  three  Members  in arrears  for two  years  or 
more  and  advise  them  that  the Health  Assembly  hopes  they  will  be able  to pay  their  contributions  as soon 
as possible  and  in any  case  by the time  of the next  World  Health  Assembly,  in order  to avoid  the question 
of suspension  of voting  rights  as provided  in Article  7 of the Constitution.
