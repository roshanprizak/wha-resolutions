REAFFIRMS the desirability of securing uniformity, insofar as is possible, in the practices of the United Nations and of the specialized agencies with regard to cost-of-living adjustments for internationally recruited staff; 2. EXPRESSES the hope that a workable system of salary differentials which will equitably and properly adjust the salaries of employees of the United Nations and specialized agencies ona uniform basis from locality to locality, to account for differences in living costs and other pertinent considerations, will be worked outby the United Nations and the specialized agencies ; 3 LOOKS FORWARD to the consideration of such a system by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its session in 1952 and by the Sixth World Health Assembly.
