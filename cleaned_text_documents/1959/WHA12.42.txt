I The Twelfth World Health Assembly, Having noted the relatively small number of Member States that have acceded to the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies; Noting that in the territories of the governments which have not acceded to this convention or are not already bound by a similar instrument there have been or maybe difficulties regarding the legal status of the staff of the Organization and particularly of its project personnel; and Recognizing that the best way to solve these difficulties would be the accession to this convention and its Annex VII by Members of the Organization, 1. URGES Members not yet parties to the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies, or to instruments conferring similar privileges, to accede to this convention and to its Annex VII and, pending such accession, to accord to the World Health Organization by executive action the benefit of the privileges and immunities which this convention and its annex provide ; and 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to invite Member States to take the appropriate action to provide the Organization with the necessary privileges and immunities. Eleventh plenary meeting, 28 May 1959 (section 4 of the fourth report of the Committee on Administration, Finance and Legal Matters)
