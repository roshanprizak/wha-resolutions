The Sixty-seventh World Health Assembly, Having considered the report on regulatory system strengthening; 1 Welcoming the efforts of the Director-General, and recognizing the pivotal role that WHO plays in supporting countries in strengthening their regulatory systems of medical products for human use and in promoting equitable access to quality, safe, efficacious, and affordable medical products; Recalling the Constitution of the World Health Organization, which affirms that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition; Recalling also United Nations General Assembly resolution 67 / 81 on global health and foreign policy, which, inter alia, recognized the importance of universal coverage in national health systems, especially through primary health care and social protection mechanisms, in the provision of access to health services for all, in particular for the poorest segments of the population; Recalli ng further resolutions WHA45.17, WHA47.17, WHA52.19, WHA54.11, WHA59.24, WHA63.12, and WHA65.19, all of which encompass aspects of the need to promote the quality, safety, efficaciousness and affordability of medicines, including blood products; Reaffirmin g resolution WHA65.19 on substandard / spurious / falsely-labelled / falsified / counterfeit medical products , which establishes anew Member State mechanism for international collaboration, from a public health perspective, excluding trade and intellectual property considerations, to prevent and control substandard / spurious / falsely-labelled / falsified / counterfeit medical products and to promote access to affordable, safe and quality medical products; Recognizing that effective regulatory systems are an essential component of health system strengthening and contribute to better public health outcomes, that regulators are an essential part of the health workforce, and that inefficient regulatory systems themselves can be a barrier to access to safe, effective and quality medical products; Recognizing also that effective regulatory systems are necessary for implementing universal health coverage, responding to the dual burden of infectious and noncommunicable diseases, and 1 Document A67 / 32. 2 For the purpose of this resolution, medical products include medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and medical devices . WHA67.20 2 achieving Millennium Development Goal 4 (Reduce child mortality) , Goal 5 (Improve maternal health) and Goal 6 (Combat HIV / AIDS, malaria and other diseases); Aware that health systems need to promote access to essential medical products and that, in order to ensure universal access to health care, rational use of medicines and the sustainability of health systems, urgent action is needed by the international community, Member States and relevant actors in health systems; Very concerned by the impact on patients of medical products of compromised quality, safety and efficacy, in terms of poisoning, inadequate or no treatment, contributions to drug resistance, the related economic burden, and erosion of public trust in the health system; Aware of the regulatory challenges presented by the ever-increasing complexities of medical product supply chains and welcoming the work plan of the Member State mechanism on substandard / spurious / falsely-labelled / falsified / counterfeit medical products ; Emphasizing WHO s role in strengthening regulatory systems for medical products from a public health perspective, and in supporting national drug regulatory authorities and relevant regional bodies in this area, and in particular in developing countries; Recalling WHO s Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, in particular element three, which calls for establishing and strengthening regulatory capacity in developing countries as one effective policy for building and improving innovative capacity, and element six, which promo tes establishing and strengthening mechanisms to improve ethical review and regulate the quality, safety and efficacy of health products and medical devices; Noting with appreciation the many existing national and regional efforts to strengthen regulatory capacity (including through a variety of models), improve regulatory coherence and convergence among regulatory authorities, and enhance good governance, including transparency indecision-making, leading to the improved availability of quality, safe, efficacious and affordable medical products, such as the European Union regulatory framework for medical products, work underway in PAHO following the adoption by its Directing Council in 2010 of resolution CD50.R9 on strengthening national regulatory authori ties for medicines and biologicals , the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization Initiative, and the regulatory harmonization and cooperation work in ASEAN; Noting the ongoing collaboration between national and regional regulatory authorities in promotin g cooperation among regulatory authorities at the regional and global level s; Recognizing the significant investments made in the procurement of medicines through national health budgets and global health initiatives; Also recognizing the essential role of WHO s prequalification programme in facilitating procurement of medical products with assured quality, safety and efficacy; Stressing that the strengthening of regulatory systems should complement the efforts of the Secretariat and Member States to promote access to affordable medical products with assured quality, safety and efficacy; WHA6 7.20 3 Recalling the WHO good clinical practices that focus on the protection of human research subjects; Recalling also WHO s ongoing reform agenda and welcoming in this regard the establishment in November 2012 of the Health Systems and Innovation cluster, 1.
