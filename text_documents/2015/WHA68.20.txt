coordinated action at the country level to address  
its health, social and public knowledge implications  
 
The Sixty -eighth  World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report by the Secretariat on the g lobal burden of epilepsy and the need 
for coordinated action at the country level to address its health, social and pu blic knowledge 
implications ;1 
Considering resolution WHA66.8, in which the Health Assembly adopted the comprehensive 
mental health action plan 2013 –2020, and resolution WHA67.22 on access to essential medicines;  
Acknowledging United Nations General Assembl y resolution 68/269 and resolution WHA57.10 
on road safety and health, resolution WHA66.12 on neglected tropical diseases, resolution WHA67.10 
on the newborn health action plan, resolution WHA67.15 on strengthening the role of the health

Noting the Political Declaration of the High -level Meeting of the United Nations General 
Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non -communicable Diseases,3 in which Heads of State 
and Government recognized that mental and neurological disorders are an important cause of 
morbidity and contribute to th e global noncommunicable disease burden, necessitating provision of 
equitable access to effective programmes and health  care interventions;  
Considering the health -related Millennium Development Goals, the outcome document of the 
United Nations Conference o n Sustainable Development entitled “The future we want”,4 and the 
report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, established pursuant to United

2 from non -communicable diseases through prevention and treatment, and promote mental health and 
well-being);1 
Recognizing that epilepsy is one of the mos t common serious chronic neurological diseases, 
affecting 50 million people of all ages globally, and that people with epilepsy are often subjected to 
stigmatization and discrimination because of ignorance, misconceptions and negative attitudes 
surrounding  the disease, and that they face serious difficulties in, for example, education, employment, 
marriage and reproduction;  
Noting with concern that the magnitude of epilepsy affects people of all ages, gender, race and 
income levels, and further that poor populations and those living in vulnerable situations, in particular 
in low - and middle -income countries, bear a disproportionate burden, posing a threat to public health 
and economic and social development;  
Cognizant that large differences exist in the le vel of epilepsy management in different countries, 
with, for example, the median number of neurologists in low -income countries standing at only 
0.03/100 000 population, that the essential antiepileptic medicines are often unavailable, that the 
treatment g ap is estimated to be over 75% in low -income countries and to be substantially wider in 
rural areas than in urban areas;  
Noting that the majority of people with epilepsy can be kept free from seizures if appropriately 
treated with cost -effective, affordabl e antiepileptic medicines;  
Recognizing in addition that certain causes of epilepsy can be prevented and that such 
preventive action can be promoted in the health sector and in sectors outside health;  
Aware that in 1997, WHO and two international nongovernmental organizations, the 
International League Against Epilepsy and the International Bureau for Epilepsy, launched the Global 
Campaign against Epilepsy – “Out of the Shadows”, and that in 2008 WHO launched its mental health 
gap action programme, which provided a sound basis for WHO to further lead and coordinate global 
development work on epilepsy;  
Aware also that practice in China and some other low -income countries has proved that country level coordinated action may be very effective in control ling the disease and improving the quality of 
life of millions of people with epilepsy at little cost;  
Recognizing the remarkable progress made recently in the technology of epilepsy management, 
from basic research to diagnosis and treatment;  
Considering t hat international governmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations, 
academic societies and other bodies have recently enhanced their investment in epilepsy management 
and have undertaken a significant amount of work in collaboration with national governments, such as 
the International League Against Epilepsy and the International Bureau for Epilepsy, which are in 
official relations with WHO and have been collaborating with WHO in epilepsy management for 
several decades;  
Recognizing the role of WHO to demonstrate further leadership and coordination and take 
effective action for epilepsy management, in view of the large public health impact,

(1) to strengthen effective leadership and governance, for policies on general health,  mental 
health and noncommunicable diseases that include consideration of the specific needs of people 
with epilepsy, and to make the financial, human and other resources available that have been 
identified, as necessary, to implement evidence -based plans and actions;  
(2) to introduce and implement, where necessary and in accordance with international human 
rights norms and standards, national health care plans of action for epilepsy management, 
aiming to overcome inequalities and inequities in health, soci al and other related services, 
paying special attention to people with epilepsy living in conditions of vulnerability, such as 
those living in poor and remote areas, including by strengthening public health care services, 
and by training local human resour ces with proper techniques;  
(3) to integrate epilepsy management, including health and social care, particularly 
community -based services, within the context of universal health coverage, including 
community -based rehabilitation, into primary health care, where appropriate, in order to help to 
reduce the epilepsy treatment gap, by training non -specialist health care providers in order to 
provide them with basic knowledge for the management of epilepsy so that epilepsy can be 
diagnosed, treated and followed up as much as possible in primary health care settings, as well 
as by empowering people with epilepsy and their carers to make  greater use of specified self - 
and home -care programmes, by ensuring a strong and functional referral system and by 
strengthening  health information and surveillance systems to routinely collect, report, analyse 
and evaluate trends on epilepsy management;  
(4) to support the establishment and implementation of strategies for the management of 
epilepsy, particularly to improve accessi bility to and promote affordability of safe, effective and 
quality -assured antiepileptic medicines and include essential antiepileptic medicines into

within the health sector and in other sectors outside health;

(2) to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, on the basis of work requested in 
operative paragraph (1), a set of technical recommendations guiding M ember States in the 
development and implementation of epilepsy programmes and services, and to provide technical
