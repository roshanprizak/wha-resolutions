WHA31.45  Malaria  control  strategy 
The Thirty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the Director-General's  report  on malaria  control  strategy; 
Recognizing  that  the critical  situation  as regards  malaria  in many  countries  in all regions  of the world 
is jeopardizing  not  only  the health  of their  populations  but  also  their  overall  socioeconomic  development; 
Considering  that  there  are areas  where  man  has  caused  the  spread  of malaria  through  the  building  of 
barrages,  dams  and  artificial  lakes; 
Aware  that  this  trend  of deterioration,  if not  checked  immediately,  would  result  in a problem  of global 
dimensions,  and  that  it could  often  be reversed  by the determination  and  political  will  of Member  countries 
and by the flexible  selection  and  judicious  utilization  of malaria  control  methods  that  are already  available； 
Considering  with  regret  that  most  of the  recommendations  in resolution  WHA22.39  adopted  by the 
Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly  when  it re-examined  the global  strategy  for malaria  eradication,  and 
in subsequent  resolutions  of the  Executive  Board  and  Health  Assembly,  have  not  been  adequately  implemented  ； 
Subscribing  with  satisfaction  to the decision  of the Executive  Board  to re-establish  an ad hoc committee 
on malaria; 
1. ENDORSES  the report  of the Director-General  ； 
2. EMPHASIZES  that  it will  not be possible  to stop  the dramatic  recrudescence  of malaria  unless  firm  national 
commitments  are made  to combat  it and  adequate  resources  are devoted  to antimalaria  activities,  nationally 
and internationally; 
3. URGES  Member  States  to reorient  their  antimalaria  programmes一with  the  final  objective  of malaria 
eradication  where  possible一as  an integral  part  of their  national  health  programmes  in accordance  with  the 
guidelines  set out  in the Director-General's  report,  and  to increase  their  commitments  (fiscal,  administrative 
and technical)  as regards  malaria  within  their  national  development  plans; 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to stimulate  and  strengthen  technical  cooperation  between  the Organization  and  its Member  States 
and among  countries  themselves  in the rapid  development  and  effective  implementation  of their  antimalaria  programmes; 
(2) to promote  intercountry  and  interregional  coordination  of the  national  antimalaria  control  programmes  ； 
(3) to provide  technical  guidance  and  support  to malaria  control  activities,  and  to study  ways  and 
means  of securing  for  Member  States  reliable  sources  of cheap  and  minimally  toxic  pesticides  and 
antimalaria  drugs; 
(4) to increase  the  Organization's  participation  in the  comprehensive  and  multipurpose  training  of 
public  health  workers  in the malaria  field; 
(5) to expand  and  support  basic  and  applied  field  research  on malaria  with  a view  to improving  antimalaria  methodology; 
(6) to identify,  stimulate,  promote  and  coordinate  international  and  bilateral  financial  involvement  and 
technical  cooperation  in the field  of malaria; 
(7) to give  a higher  priority  to the malaria  control  programme  in the proposed  programme  budget  for 
1980-1981,  whether  in the regular  budget  or through  the  mobilization  of extrabudgetary  resources,  so 
that the necessary  national  efforts  can be adequately  supported  ； 
(8) to take  the appropriate  steps  in order  to achieve  active  coordination  of malaria  control  activities 
with  those  of the Special  Programme  for Research  and  Training  in Tropical  Diseases,  thus  ensuring  the 
quickest  possible  implementation  of any  new  technology; 
(9) to review  WHO's  functional  structures  where  malaria  is concerned  so as to gear  the Organization 
to undertake  a comprehensive,  purposeful  and  effective  drive,  with  the goal  of speedy  control  of the 
disease; 
(10) to report  to the Executive  Board  and  to the Thirty-third  World  Health  Assembly  on the evolution 
of the malaria  situation  and  on the implementation  of the malaria  control  strategy  by Member  States 
and by the Organization.
