WHA3.117  Programme  and  Budget  for 1951 
Whereas  the Third  World  Health  Assembly  has adopted  the following  resolution  :108 
The Third  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that  the budget  for 1951  has been  established  at US $7,300,000  ; 
Recognizing  that  expenditure  should  not exceed  the funds  reasonably  expected  to be available  for the financial  year  1951, 
AUTHORIZES  the Executive  Board  at any  session  to establish  and  adjust  the expenditure  level  as it may consider  desirable  on the basis  of significant  changes  in the financial  position  of the Organization, giving  due consideration  to the administrative  problems  created  by fluctuations  in the authorized  level of expenditure  ; 
Whereas  it may  be that  the income  which  can reasonably  be expected  to be received  in respect  of 1951 will be substantially  less than  the budget  appropriated  ; 
Whereas  it is desirable  that  a decision  be reached  as to the activities  and functions  of the Organization  to be carried  out in 1951  within  the limitations  of the expenditure  level  to be established  by the Executive  Board, 
The Third  World  Health  Assembly 
INSTRUCTS  the Executive  Board  to establish  these  activities  and functions  after  considering  the discussion on this  matter  during  the Third  World  Health  Assembly  and,  in particular  : 
(1) the  present  level  of activities, 
(2) the  programme  priorities  established  at this or previous  sessions  of the Health  Assembly, 
(3) the  desirability  that  as much  as possible  of the  resources  of the  Organization  be used  in field operations  and  the furnishing  of fellowships  and technical  services.
