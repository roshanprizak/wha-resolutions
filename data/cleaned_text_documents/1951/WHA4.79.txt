Whereas measures other than those specified in the International Sanitary Regulations (WHO Regu-lations No. 2) are needed to protect isolated communities into which the introduction of epidemic diseases other than the six quarantinable diseases may cause considerable morbidity and mortality ; Whereas such measures should be the object of careful study from the scientific and practical points of view, The Fourth World Health Assembly REQUESTS the Executive Board to entrust such study to the appropriate WHO committee, this com-mittee being requested to take into consideration the following suggestions : (1) health administrations should be permitted to decide the sanitary measuresother than those specified in these Regulationsto be taken for the protection of isolated communities into which the introduction of epidemic diseases other than the six quarantinable diseases may cause considerable loss of life, owing to the extreme susceptibility of their populations to such diseases ; (2) such measures should, however, be taken only in respect of those isolated communities situated in areas or territories which have been notified in advance by the health administration concerned to WHO as being specially at risk and have been approved as such by the Organization ; and (3) the Organization should notify all other health administrations of such approval.
