WHA31.54 Smallpox  eradication  programme  : Current  status  and  certification 
The Thirty-first  World  Health  Assembly， 
Having  considered  the Director-General's  report  on smallpox  eradication  ； 
Endorsing  the Executive  Board's  resolution  EB61.R10  on smallpox  eradication; 
Recognizing  that  for  six months  reported  smallpox  incidence  throughout  the  world  has  been  nil,  that 
achievement  of smallpox  eradication  is now  imminent,  and  that  it will  constitute  an unprecedented  event  in 
the history  of medicine; 
1. CONGRATULATES  Somalia  on the effective  eradication  campaign  and  adjacent  countries  on their  intensive 
surveillance  and  maintenance  of their  smallpox-free  status; 
2. COMMENDS  Bangladesh,  Burma,  the nine  countries  of central  Africa  (Burundi,  Central  African  Empire, 
Chad,  Congo,  Equatorial  Guinea,  Gabon,  Rwanda,  United  Republic  of Cameroon,  and  Zaire),  and  the 
four countries  of south-east  Africa  (Malawi,  Mozambique,  United  Republic  of Tanzania,  and  Zambia)  where 
international  commissions  have  visited  and  certified  eradication  of smallpox  in 1977  and  in 1978  to date; 
3. REQUESTS  the 31 countries  where  certification  activities  will  take  place  in 1978  and  1979  to proceed  with 
their  planned  activities,  in collaboration  with  WHO  and  the  Global  Commission  for  the Certification  of 
Smallpox  Eradication  so that  these  activities  can be completed  by the end of 1979; 
4. REQUESTS  all laboratories  except  WHO  collaborating  centres  to destroy  or transfer  remaining  stocks  of 
variola  virus  to a collaborating  centre  ； 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to establish  a reward  of US $1000  for the first  person  who,  in the period 
preceding  final  certification  of global  eradication,  reports  an active  case  of smallpox  resulting  from  personto-person  transmission  and  confirmed  by laboratory  tests,  in the belief  that  such  a reward  will  strengthen 
worldwide  vigilance  for smallpox  as well  as national  surveillance  in priority  countries; 
6. REITERATES  the final  paragraph  of the Executive  Board's  resolution  EB61.R10,  which  urged  all governments  to continue  full  support  and  cooperation  for this  final  phase  of the programme.
