WHA18.38  Smallpox  Eradication  Programme 
The Eighteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  examined  the  report  of the Director-General  on the  present  status  of smallpox  in the world, 
and the results  achieved  ;1 
Noting  with  concern  that,  though  some  recently  endemic  countries  have  eradicated  the  disease  as a 
result  of well  organized  campaigns,  progress  in general  is slow  and  major  endemic  foci  remain  in Asia, 
Africa  and  the Americas; 
Noting  that  the  Director-General  has  estimated  that  smallpox  might  be eradicated  within  ten  years 
for an estimated  international  expenditure  of from  US  $23  500  000  to US  $31  000  000  in addition  to the 
provision  which  the countries  having  endemic  smallpox  themselves  can  make  ; 
Believing  that  strong  reaffirmation  of the intent  to eradicate  smallpox  would  present  a challenge  and  a 
stimulus  to the  world  to mobilize  resources  to achieve  the  objective,  and  that  the  support  required  is 
available  within  the international  and  national  programmes  devoted  to world  social  and  economic  development;  and 
Recognizing  the need  to review  the technical  and  administrative  requirements  of programmes,  to ensure 
the extensive  use  of freeze-dried  vaccine  and  the  development  of its production  in endemic  areas  and  to 
provide  annually  for  the  mass  phase  of the  campaign  up to 50 million  doses  of freeze-dried  vaccine  in 
addition  to supplies  locally  produced  or already  being  provided  in bilateral  agreements,  or through 
voluntary  contributions, 
1. DECLARES  the world-wide  eradication  of smallpox  to be one  of the major  objectives  of the Organization; 
2. REQUESTS  the  countries  having  smallpox  but  no eradication  programmes  to initiate  them  and  the 
countries  with  programmes  to intensify  them; 
3. REQUESTS  Member  States  to give  the programme  greater  support  than  in the  past  and  to provide  the 
substantial  contributions  essential  for its execution; 
4. REQUESTS  governments  which  carry  on bilateral  programmes  of aid to include  smallpox  eradication  in 
their  programmes  of assistance; 
5. REQUESTS  governments  to take  early  steps  to establish  basic  health  services  for the maintenance  phase 
which  would  also  serve  for the eradication  of other  communicable  diseases; 
6. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to seek  anew  the  necessary  financial  and  other  resources  required  to 
achieve  world-wide  smallpox  eradication  with  special  reference  to resources  that  might  be made  available 
through  voluntary  contributions  and  bilateral  programmes,  as well  as through  programmes  such  as those 
of UNICEF  and  the United  Nations  Expanded  Programme  of Technical  Assistance  ; and 
7. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to make  available  the  increased  amount  of technical  guidance  and 
advisory  services  necessary  to accelerate  the  programme  as well  as to assist  countries  in obtaining  the 
necessary  vaccine,  transport  and  other  equipment,  and  to report  on the progress  achieved  to future  sessions 
of the World  Health  Assembly.
