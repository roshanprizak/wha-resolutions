New，emerging  and  re-emerging  infectious  diseases: 
special  programme  on malaria 
The Forty-ninth  World Health Assembly, 
Noting with concern that the global malaria situation  is serious and that malaria remains a major global 
priority, essential for the achievement  of health for all, with an annual incidence  of between 300 and 500 
million clinical cases, African countries  south of the Sahara accounting  for more than 90% of the global 
burden; 
Alarmed by the death toll from malaria of about one million in children below the age of five years 
and by the extension  and intensification  of resistance  to many antimalarials; 
Deeply concerned  at the recent occurrence  of extensive  malaria epidemics,  particularly  in Africa, due 
to civil disorders,  or major ecological  changes and movements  of refugees and displaced  populations; 
Noting with regret that WHO response  is inadequate  to deal with the explosive  situation  while 
acknowledging  the intensive  efforts undertaken  by the technical  staff of the Organization  in spite of the 
limited resources  available  for the purpose; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA38.24,  WHA42.30,  and WHA46.32  as well as resolutions  1994/34 and 
1995/63 of the United Nations Economic  and Social Council,  which called for increased  resources  for 
preventive  action and intensification  of the struggle against malaria in developing  countries,  particularly  in 
Africa, and urged WHO, as the lead agency in international  health, to continue  to provide in collaboration 
with the United Nations agencies  and programmes  concerned  the technical  expertise  and support to the agreed 
malaria control strategies  and workplans; 
Recognizing  that any further delay in intensifying  the struggle against malaria will cost millions more 
lives and put the Organization  in an untenable  situation  as the leader of international  health work in disease 
control, 
1. URGES  Member  States to take action to participate  fully in a reestablished  action programme  on 
malaria concentrating  on ways and means of preventing  and controlling  the disease, including  the research 
and training activities  needed to accomplish  these goals, and recommends  that malaria control should be 
developed  as an integral part of primary health care in the national systems; 
2. URGES  regional  committees  to ensure that the programme  is vigorously  pursued in their region and 
that to this end regional and subregional  plans of action are prepared  and adequate  resources  allocated  to the 
programme  and subsequently  in the regional programme  budgets; 
WHA49.11 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to explore the possibility  of establishing  a special programme  on 
malaria; 
4. FURTHER  REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to intensify  his efforts to increase the extrabudgetary  resources  for the special account on malaria 
on the basis of a plan of action for intensification  of the programme  and to submit a report to the 
ninety-ninth  session of the Executive  Board on the progress  made, including  the commitment  of 
additional  resources; 
(2) to reinforce  the malaria training programme  at the country,  regional  and global levels.
