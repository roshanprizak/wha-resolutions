Annex 1 
DECLARATION  OF PERSONAL  COMMITMENT 
We, the participants  at the Technical  Discussions  on "Leadership  Development 
for Health for All" (held in Geneva on 5-7 May 1988, during the Forty-First  World 
Health Assembly),  representing  people from many walks of life, including  governments, 
nongovernmental  organizations,  universities,  educational  institutions,  voluntary 
agencies,  United Nations  agencies,  make the following  declaration: 
I • We believe  that : 
- There  is a need for greater  concern  and commitment  to achieve  the goal of 
Health for All by the Year 2000 through  primary  health care, among political, 
professional  and community  leaders； 
- Building  self-reliance  and leadership  capabilities  at local level is the most 
important  ingredient  for sustained  development  and progress  in health; 
- The  development  of leadership  that can be sustained  as a continuing  process  at 
all levels is an important  strategy  to mobilize  greater  social and political 
commitment  for the total Health-for-All  movement. 
II. We therefore  commit ourselves  and urge others in leadership  and other strategic 
positions  to adopt the following  Five-point  Personal  Agenda for Action: 
1. To inform ourselves,  our colleagues,  fellow-workers,  community  members  and 
others about the fundamental  values,  principles  and processes  to achieve  Health 
for All by the Year 2000 through  primary  health care, and to generate  a social 
conscience  in people to the health conditions  and needs of the under-served, 
socially  deprived  and vulnerable  population  groups； 
2. To make a serious  review of progress  towards  the specific  targets  set in 
our respective  countries,  to identify  where the critical  needs and gaps are, 
and to provide  leadership  in identifying  and implementing  corrective  actions； 
3. To serve as prime movers for change,  particularly  in areas which fall 
within our respective  roles, and to motivate  others to accelerate  the changes 
required  in order to achieve  the goal of Health for All； 
4. To develop  and promote  partnerships  and new alliances  of support  for 
health, including  the professional  associations,  institutions  of higher 
education,  religious  leaders,  people's  organizations,  concerned  nongovernmental 
organizations  and individuals,  philanthropic  groups,  the private  sector and the 
media; 
5. To promote  self-reliance  and enable others.  particularly  within the home 
and community  level, to take greater  responsibility  for their own health and 
the health of their communities,  through  informing  and educating  them and 
developing  their leadership  potential. 
III. We are convinced  that additional  courageous  and innovative  strategies  and 
tactics will be needed to ensure that all people of the world will be covered  by 
primary health care. Leadership  development  is one such strategy  which provides  new 
opportunities  to inform and communicate,  to expand partnerships  among people - people 
who are empowered  and motivated  - who then take on new responsibilities  for their 
health, the health of their families  and of their communities.
