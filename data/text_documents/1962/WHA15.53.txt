WHA15.53  Smallpox  Eradication  Programme 
The Fifteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the Director-General  on smallpox  eradication; 
Noting  that  the progress  made  since  the Eleventh  World  Health  Assembly  in 1958  took  the decision 
to initiate  a world-wide  eradication  programme  has  been  slow; 
Recognizing  that  countries  in the  endemic  areas  are  meeting  difficulties  in organizing  country-wide 
campaigns  owing  to insufficient  funds  and health  personnel,  inadequacy  of transport,  vaccine  and  equipment  ; 
Reiterating  that  the persistence  of the disease  causes  a high  morbidity  and  mortality  in the endemic 
areas  and  exposes  the rest  of the world  to risk  from  importation  of infection, 
1. EMPHASIZES  the urgency  of achieving  eradication; 
2. COMMENDS  the efforts  already  made  in those  countries  which  are implementing  eradication  campaigns; 
3. URGES  the health  administrations  of those  endemic  countries  which  have  not already  done  so to plan  and 
implement  country-wide  eradication  campaigns  with  stable  potent  vaccine,  in concert  with  their  neighbours; 
4. INVITES  countries  able  to do so to make  voluntary  contributions  in cash  or in kind  of such  essential 
requirements  as freeze-dried  vaccines,  suitable  transport  and  necessary  laboratory  and  cold-storage  equipment 
for distribution  by the Organization  to countries  in the endemic  areas  with  sound  eradication  programmes 
requesting  such  assistance;  and 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(a) to continue  to offer  advice  and  technical  guidance  to the  countries  concerned; 
(b) to provide  for  the  necessary  activities  and  material  assistance  in his programme  and  budget 
estimates  for  future  years; 
(c) to prepare,  with  the aid of national  governments,  their  requirements  and  firm  estimates  of costs 
for their  smallpox  eradication  programmes;  and 
(d) to report  further  to the Sixteenth  World  Health  Assembly  on the progress  of the eradication  programme.
