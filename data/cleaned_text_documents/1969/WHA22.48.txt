a The Twenty-second World Health Assembly, Having considered the recommendations of the Committee on International Quarantine in its fifteenth report, Volume A; Noting the present and the expected further increase in international traffic; Considering that areas of the world from which malaria has been eradicated will thus become more vulnerable to the re-establishment of malaria caused by imported cases; and Believing that exchange of information on the malaria situation in the world is of fundamental importance in determining the appropriate vigilance measures tobe applied, 1. RECOMMENDS that each health administration should notify the Organization twice A year, in September for the first six months of the year, and in March for the whole of the previous calendar year, of : (i) the originally malarious areas with no risk of infection (areas which are in the maintenance phase of a malaria eradication programme); (ii) malaria cases imported into areas in the maintenance phase; (iii) areas with chloroquine-resistant strains of parasites and (iv) international ports and airports free from malaria; and 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to publish this information twice yearly, and, in addition, once A year, a map showing areas where there is risk of infection. Handb.
