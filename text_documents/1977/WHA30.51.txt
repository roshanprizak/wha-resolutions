WHA30.51  The  role  of the  health  sector  in the development  of national  and  international  food  and  nutrition 
policies  and  plans 
The Thirtieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  reviewed  in detail  the background  document  for the Technical  Discussions  on the importance 
of national  and  international  food  and  nutrition  policies  for health  development,  and  having  reviewed  the 
report  of the Technical  Discussions  held  on this  subject  at the current  session  ； 
Recognizing  that  malnutrition  is one  of the major  health  problems  in the world,  becoming  all the more 
evident  as some  communicable  diseases  are  being  controlled;  and  that  dietary  deficits  in the  developing 
countries  and  excesses  and  imbalances  in developed  countries  continue  to affect  adversely  the health  of large 
sectors  of the population  in both  groups  of countries; 
Recognizing  the need  also  for improved  quality  and  safety  of food,  particularly  in relation  to the process 
of industrialization; 
Concerned  at the  inadequate  attention  and  commitments  being  given  by the health  and  other  sectors  in 
a great  number  of countries  to improve  this  critical  situation; 
1. EXPRESSES  its general  agreement  with  the conclusions  and  recommendations  that  have  emerged  from  the 
Technical  Discussions; 
2. URGES  governments  : 
(1) to give  higher  priority  to food  and  nutrition  problems  within  their  health  programmes  ； 
(2) to further  develop  multisectoral  programmes  specifically  oriented  to improve  the  nutritional 
situation  of the population,  and  to improve  the quality  of food; 
(3) to consider  the food  and  nutritional  implications  of their  development  policies  and  plans; 
(4) to give  to these  actions  greater  political,  technical  and  financial  support  than  heretofore; 
(5) to pay  attention  to both  qualitative  and  quantitative  aspects  of nutrition; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to take  the additional  necessary  steps  to strengthen  the  WHO  nutrition  programme  in order  that 
the Organization  may  play  its legitimate  role  in the development  and  implementation  of national  and 
international  food  and  nutrition  policies  and  plans,  with  the aim  of : 
(a) providing  the necessary  stimulus  and  technical  cooperation  to Member  countries  for improving 
the efficiency  and  effectiveness  of their  health  services  in health-related  nutritional  programmes  ； 
(b) strengthening  the  research  capacity  and  education  and  training  in nutritional  programmes, 
with  priority  in the developing  countries; 
(c) eliminating  the florid  forms  of malnutrition  such  as kwashiorkor,  marasmus  and  keratomalacia 
as public  health  problems  at least  by the turn  of this  century; 
(d) identifying  problem  areas  such  as the interaction  between  malnutrition  on the one  hand  and 
infection  and  productive  capacity  on the other,  and  hence  integrating  relevant  action  programmes; 
(e) determining  the  most  vulnerable  population  groups  (groups  at risk)  in relation  to the  programmes  for protecting  the health  of mothers  and  children  and  of the working  population; 
(J) establishing  priorities  in regard  to health-related  nutritional  problems,  according  to the 
particular  conditions  of the country; 
(g) developing  systems  for nutritional  surveillance  as a basis  for action  programmes  and  for their 
evaluation; 
(/?) developing  systems  for the control  of contamination  of foodstuffs  by pesticides,  mycotoxins, 
and other  toxic  substances; 
(/) supporting  ministries  of health  in their  efforts  to introduce  nutritional  objectives  in the national 
development  plans,  and  to develop  and  implement  multisectoral  food  and  nutrition  policies  and 
programmes  ； 
(2) to consult  with  Member  States  and  relevant  national  and  international  agencies  in order  to obtain 
assistance  in the development  of intensified  nutrition  programmes,  including  the technical  and  financial 
aspects  ； 
(3) to report  on the progress  being  made  on the implementation  of this  programme  to the sixty-first 
session  of the Executive  Board  and  to the Thirty-first  World  Health  Assembly.
