3 The Eighth World Health Assembly, Having considered resolutions WHA7.15 and WHA7.16 of the Seventh World Health Assembly and the results of the study carried outby the Executive Board at its fifteenth session ;4 and Considering that the World Health Assembly in its previous sessions has expressed the opinion that the United Nations scale should be used as a basis of determining the scale of assessment tobe used by WHO, taking account of (a) the difference in membership ; and (b) the establishment of minima and maxima, including the provision that no country shall be required to pay more per capita than the per capita contribution of the highest contributor, 1. DCIDS that WHO should progress toward the full application of these principles in four annual stages, as provided in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 below ; 2. DECIDES that the WHO scale of assessment should be established as provided in this paragraph, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 : (1) that the United Nations scale of assessment for 1955 as adjusted to the WHO membership shall be adopted for 1956, provided that only one-fourth of the adjustment to make the revision in the WHO 1955 scale shall be effected in establishing the 1956 WHO scale ; (2) that the United Nations scale of assessment for 1956 as adjusted to the WHO membership shall be adopted for 1957, provided that only one-third of the adjustment to make the revision in the WHO 1956 scale shall be effected in establishing the 1957 WHO scale ; (3) that the United Nations scale of assessment for 1957 as adjusted to the WHO membership shall be adopted for 1958, provided that only one-half of the adjustment to make the revision in the WHO 1957 scale shall be effected in establishing the WHO 1958 scale ; (4) that the United Nations scale of assessment for 1958 as adjusted to the WHO membership shall be adopted for 1959 ; and (5) that in establishing the scale of assessment tobe used in 1960 and future years, the Health Assembly shall further adjust the WHO scale to take into account the latest available United Nations scale of assessment ; 3. DECIDES that, in the application of the principle that the maximum assessment of anyone Member shall not exceed 33 Vs per cent., such maximum assessment shall be calculated as a percentage of the total assessments of the Members actively participating in the work of the Organization, and that this principle shall be progressively implemented in relation to the WHO 1955 scale in four annual stages, as follows : (1) for 1956, one-fourth of the adjustment shall be applied ; (2) for 1957, one-half of the adjustment shall be applied ; (3) for 1958, three-fourths of the adjustment shall be applied ; and (4) for 1959 and future years, the full adjustment shall be applied, provided that, in the event of the return to active participation of some or all of the non-participating Members, the provisions of this paragraph shall be reconsidered by the Health Assembly with a view to accelerating the date by which the maximum assessment would be 331 / s per cent. ; 4. DECIDES that the per capita limitation principle shall be progressively implemented over a period of four years, as follows : (1) for 1956, one-fourth of the adjustments shall be applied ; (2) for 1957, one-half of the adjustments shall be applied ; (3) for 1958, three-fourths of the adjustments shall be applied ; and (4) for 1959 and future years, the full application of the per capita ceiling shall be made ; 5. Believing that the special assessments established by the Fourth World Health Assembly for Korea and Austria should be continued for 1956, and Noting the special requests of Burma and Ceylon, DECIDES (1) that the assessment of Korea shall remain fixed at 0.04 per cent. ; (2) that for 1956 only the assessments of Austria, Burma and Ceylon shall remain the same as for 1955 and that the situation in respect of these three countries shall be reviewed by the Executive Board and by the Ninth World Health Assembly.
