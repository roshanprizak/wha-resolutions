REITERATES the request of the Seventh World Health Assembly in resolution WHA7.35, " in the event that the UNICEF Executive Board decides to begin action on any jointly assisted projects for which WHO is unable to provide the finances required for the technical personnel required, that the UNICEF Executive Board at the same time decide to reimburse WHO for the health personnel required, inaccordance with the agreed principles governing co-operation between UNICEF and WHO, until such time as WHO is able to make financial provision therefor "; 3. DECIDES that an amount of $240 000 shall be added to the proposals of the Director-General in order to provide for half the costs of the international health personnel in jointly assisted UNICEF / WHO projects shown under " Other Extra-budgetary Funds " in the proposed programme and budget estimates for 1956;2 4. EXPRESSES the hope that the UNICEF Executive Board will provide funds for the other half of the costs referred to in paragraph 3 above, together with the funds required for any new activities initiated, as foreseen in paragraph 2 above, unless such funds are provided in the Technical Assistance programmes for 1956, following appropriate requests by the governments concerned ; 5.
