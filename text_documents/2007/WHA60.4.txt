The Sixtieth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the third report of the Programme, Budget and Administration Committee of 
the Executive Board to the Sixtieth World Health Assembly on Status of collection of assessed contributions, including Member States in arrears in the payment of their contributions to an extent 
that would justify invoking Article 7 of the Constitution;
1  
Noting that, at the time of opening of the Sixtieth World Health Assembly, the voting rights of 
Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Central African Republic, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominica, Guinea-Bissau, Kyrgyzstan, and Somalia were suspended, such suspension to continue 
until the arrears of the Member State concerned have been reduced, at the present or future Health 
Assemblies, to a level below the amount that would justify invoking Article 7 of the Constitution; 
Noting that Cape Verde was in arrears at the time of the opening of the Sixtieth World Health

suspended at the opening of the Sixty-first World Health Assembly, 
DECIDES: 
(1) that in accordance with the statement of principles set out in resolution WHA41.7 if, by 
the time of the opening of the Sixty-first World Health Assembly, Cape Verde was still in 
arrears in the payment of its contributions to an extent that would justify invoking Article 7 of 
the Constitution, its voting privileges shall be suspended as from the said opening;
