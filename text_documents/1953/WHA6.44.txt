The Sixth  World  Health  Assembly

regionalization  ; 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to provide,  through  the staff  at headquarters,  guidance  to the regional 
offices  on specific  programmes,  assistance  in long-term  planning,  and  control  and  co-ordination  of regional 
programmes  to ensure  that  they  conform  to the principles  and  policies  established  by the Health  Assembly, 
the Executive  Board  and  the Director-General  ; 
6. RECOMMENDS  the interchange  of staff  of the Secretariat  among  regions  and  between  headquarters  and

7. NOTES  that  variations  in constitution,  objectives  and  organization  produce  wide  differences  in the nature

agencies,  and  that  such  differences  often  impede  effective  co-operation  in field  programmes  ;

United  Nations  and  to provide  the utmost  co-operation  in finding  a solution  ; and 
9. EXPRESSES  its belief  that  the  undoubted  advantages  of regionalization  can  be fully  achieved  only  by 
continued  mutual  confidence  and  co-operation  among  all those  to whom  the Constitution  and  the Health 
Assembly  have  delegated  responsibility  and  authority  ; 
II. Realizing  the difficulties  of foreseeing  at this  time  the amounts  of budgetary  contributions  and  the 
financial  state  of the Organization  in 1955  ;

of regional  committees  would  not go into  effect  until  1955,  according  to Part  II of the resolution  proposed 
by the Executive  Board  (EB11.R50),

consideration  until  the Seventh  World  Health  Assembly  ; 
III. DECIDES  that  Part  III of the  proposed  resolution,  on the  question  of holding  sessions  of regional 
committees  at regional  headquarters,  shall  also  be referred  for comment  to the regional  committees  and
