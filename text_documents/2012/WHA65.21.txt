Agenda item 13.11 26 May 2012 
Elimination of schistosomiasis 
 
The Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on the elimination of schistosomiasis; 1 
Recalling resolutions WHA3.26, WHA28.53, WHA29.58 a nd WHA54.19 on schistosomiasis; 
Noting the resolution EM/RC54/R.3 on neglected trop ical diseases: an emerging public health 
problem in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, adopte d by the Regional Committee for the Eastern 
Mediterranean, which called on Member States, inter  alia, to sustain successful control activities in 
areas of low transmission in order to eliminate sch istosomiasis; 
Expressing concern that schistosomiasis remains a m ajor public health problem in countries 
endemic for the disease, and that the goal set in r esolution WHA54.19 of attaining a minimum target 
of regular administration of chemotherapy to at lea st 75% of school-age children at risk of morbidity 
was not achieved by 2010; 
Noting the extension in coverage of treatment of sc histosomiasis from 12 million people in 
2006 to 32.6 million people in 2010, the greater ac cess to praziquantel as a result of donations, and 
increased support from partners to countries endemi c for the disease for control of neglected tropical  
diseases; 
Congratulating Member States, the Secretariat and p artners for increasing access to praziquantel 
and resources to scale up schistosomiasis control; 
Encouraged that some countries endemic for schistos omiasis have interrupted its transmission; 
Congratulating those countries endemic for schistos omiasis that, with strengthened control 
programmes and surveillance, have reported no new a utochthonous cases of schistosomiasis, 
1. CALLS ON all countries endemic for schistosomias is: 
(1) to attach importance to prevention and control of schistosomiasis, to analyse and develop 
applicable plans with progressive targets, to inten sify control interventions and to strengthen 
surveillance;

2. URGES Member States, the Secretariat and partner s to provide support to countries endemic for 
schistosomiasis to expand control programmes; 
3. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to encourage Member States and the internationa l community to make available the 
necessary and sufficient means and resources, parti cularly medicines, and water, sanitation, and 
hygiene interventions, to intensify control program mes in most disease-endemic countries and 
initiate elimination campaigns, where appropriate; 
(2) to prepare guidance for Member States in order to determine when to initiate elimination 
campaigns, along with methods for implementing prog rammes and documenting success; 
(3) to assess, on request, the interruption of tran smission in the appropriate Member States, to 
analyse the global status of schistosomiasis preven tion and control, the epidemic model, and key 
challenges, so as to provide targeted recommendatio ns and guidance; 
(4) to elaborate a procedure to evaluate the interr uption of transmission of schistosomiasis in 
the countries concerned with a view to certifying t hat transmission has been eliminated in these 
countries; 
(5) during the post-elimination phase, to support c ountries that have been certified free of 
schistosomiasis to pursue preventive actions design ed to avoid the reintroduction of 
transmission of the disease; 
(6) to report every three years through the Executi ve Board to the World Health Assembly on
