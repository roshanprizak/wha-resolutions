Having adopted the written silence procedure through decision WHA73(7) (2020);2 Recalling resolutions WHA53.15 (2000) on food safety and WHA63.3 (2010) on advancing food safety initiatives, and acknowledging that the challenges outlined in these resolutions continue as the food safety systems of many Member States are under development and need significant improvements in their key components, such as regulatory infrastructure, enforcement, surveillance, inspection, laboratory capacity and capability, coordination mechanisms, emergency response and food safety education and training; Recalling also the international conferences in 2019 on food safety convened by WHO, FAO, and WTO and the African Union in Addis Ababa and Geneva, which identified key actions and strategies to tackle current and future challenges to food safety globally; Noting that food safety plays a critical role in the achievement of many of the Sustainable Development Goals and contributes to relevant areas of WHOs Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 20192023 and efforts to address universal health coverage; Considering that WHO published estimates on the global burden of foodborne diseases for the first time in 2015, in which it estimated that more than 600 million cases of foodborne illnesses and 420 000 deaths could occur in a year;3 and that the burden of foodborne diseases falls disproportionately on groups in vulnerable situations and especially on children under 5 years of age, with the highest burden in developing countries; 1 See Annex 3 for the financial and administrative implications for the Secretariat of this resolution. 2 See also document A73/4. 3 WHO estimates of the global burden of foodborne diseases: foodborne disease burden epidemiology reference group 2007-2015.

RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 19 Recognizing that innovation and developments in science and technology are advancing and, in particular, that data relevant to food safety are increasingly available, and that technology to derive insights from data is increasingly affordable; that these contribute to and support the design, management, reinforcement, implementation and maintenance of effective national food safety systems; and that such approaches hold promise for improved food safety outcomes throughout all stages of the global supply chain, thereby also increasing consumer confidence; Recalling that food business operators, at every stage of the food chain, have the role of, and responsibility for, ensuring the safety of their food products, 1. URGES Member States:1 (1) to remain committed at the highest political level: to recognizing food safety as an essential element of public health; to developing food safety policies that take into consideration, as applicable, at all stages of the supply chain, the best available scientific evidence and advice as well as innovation; and to providing adequate resources at appropriate levels for improving systems to ensure food safety; (2) to integrate food safety into national and regional policies on health, agriculture, trade, environment and development, as a means to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to take coherent actions across all relevant sectors in order to promote food safety, while recognizing consumer interests; (3) to strengthen cross-sector collaboration, using a health-in-all-policies approach, and to apply a One Health approach to promote the sustainability and availability of, and access to, safe, sufficient and nutritious food for all populations, while recognizing the importance of affordability; (4) to participate actively, and support inclusive participation, in the standard-setting work of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, including as a Member State, donor or beneficiary of the Codex Trust Fund, as well as by supporting the joint expert bodies of WHO and FAO, including through the provision of experts and data; and to take into account Codex standards, guidelines and recommendations when developing national legislation; (5) to enhance participation in the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN), including supporting the timely transmission of data, information and knowledge about food-safety emergencies; and to further develop and implement the core capacities required for participation in the Network; (6) to promote coherent actions to tackle foodborne antimicrobial resistance, including by actively supporting the work of relevant national bodies together with intergovernmental groups, such as the Codex ad hoc Intergovernmental Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance; (7) to promote increased use of Codex standards, guidelines and recommendations by governments, food business and other relevant operators, at all levels; (8) to provide appropriate investment in national food safety systems and innovations in order to prevent food safety threats, including those associated with food fraud, and enable a rapid and appropriate response to food safety emergencies; 1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations. 20 SEVENTY-THIRD WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY (9) to improve the availability, sharing and use of scientific data and evidence to support food safety decisions, including through the systematic monitoring of foodborne hazards and surveillance of foodborne disease outbreaks, as well as through timely reporting of this information through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN); (10) to promote the use of food safety management tools among food business operators at all levels, including small-scale producers, and to encourage private sector investment in safe and sustainable production and supply chains; (11) to recognize that consumers also have a role in managing food safety risks under their control and that, where relevant, they should be provided with information on how to achieve this, through the promotion of a culture of food safety by means of education and training in communities and schools in order to foster dialogue and inspire actions that enhance public awareness of food safety and that are aimed at increasing public confidence; (12) to recognize World Food Safety Day as an important milestone and a platform for raising awareness at all levels of the importance of food safety, and for promoting and facilitating actions to prevent foodborne diseases at local, national, regional and global levels; (13) to participate in national, regional and global activities aimed at applying innovative food safety strategies, including enhancing traceability and early detection of contamination, to improve the supply chain and promote cost-effective and efficient food safety systems and simple, easy-to-use laboratory analysis; 2.
