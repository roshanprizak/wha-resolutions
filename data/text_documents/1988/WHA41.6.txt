STATUS OF COLLECTION  OF ASSESSED  CONTRIBUTIONS 
AND STATUS OF ADVANCES  TO THE WORKING CAPITAL  FUND WHA41.6 
11 May 1988 
The Forty-first  World Health Assembly, 
Noting with concern  that as at 31 December  1987 : 
(a) the rate of collection  in 1987 of current year contributions  in respect of the 
effective  working budget amounted  to 78.47%, being the second-lowest  rate since the 
year 1950; 
(b) only 88 Members had paid their current year contributions  to the effective 
working budget in full, and 50 Members had made no payment  towards their current 
year contributions； 
1. EXPRESSES  concern  at the alarming  deterioration  in the payment of contributions, 
which has had a deleterious  effect on programme  implementation  and the financial 
situation  during the current financial  period; 
2. CALLS THE ATTENTION  of all Members to Financial  Regulation  5.6, which provides  that 
instalments  of contributions  and advances  shall be considered  as due and payable in full 
by the first day of the year to which they relate, and to the importance  of paying 
contributions  as early as possible  to enable the Director-General  to implement  the 
programme  budget in an orderly manner； 
3. URGES Members that systematically  make a practice  of late payment of contributions 
to take whatever  steps may be necessary  to ensure earlier payment； 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to draw the contents  of this resolution  to the 
attention  of all Members.
