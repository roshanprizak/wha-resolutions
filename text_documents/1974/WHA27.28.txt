WHA27.28  Health  education  of children  and  young  people 
The Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Taking  into  account  the basic  principles  set forth  in the WHO  Constitution  and  particularly  the fact  that 
healthy  growth  and  development  of the child  are of basic  importance  and  that  ability  to live  harmoniously  in 
a changing  total  environment  is essential  to such  development; 
Recalling  the  declaration  adopted  by the United  Nations  General  Assembly  in resolution  2037  (XX) 
on the promotion  among  youth  of the ideals  of peace,  mutual  respect  and  understanding  between  peoples; 
Aware  of the important  role  played  by the younger  generation  in every  domain  of human  activity  and 
also of the fact  that  in our era the enthusiasm  and  creative  talents  of the young  should  be dedicated  to promoting the material  and  spiritual  progress  of all peoples  ； 
Taking  into  account  the fact  that  WHO，s  activities  should  not  be concerned  solely  with  the prevention 
and control  of physical  and  mental  illness  but that  special  attention  should  also  be paid  to the harmonious 
development  and  training  of the rising  generations  with  a view  to the building  of a healthy  society  ； 
Considering  the important  role  of health  education  and  of the multiplicity  and  complexity  of educational 
factors,  within  the family,  the school  and  other  institutions,  in the training  of children  and  young  people  and 
in protecting  them  against  the undesirable  features  of our  era  (the  tobacco  habit,  alcoholism,  drugs,  etc.)； 
and 
Considering  that  WHO  possesses  an authority  and  an exalted  prestige  based  on the positive  solutions 
found  for many  major  health  problems  relying  on the experience  of national  medical  and  health  staffs, 
DEEMS  IT NECESSARY: 
(1) to intensify  within  WHO'S  programmes  concrete  and  effective  action  to ensure  that  children  and 
young  people  receive  a multidisciplinary  health  education,  which  is of particular  importance  for  the 
development  of future  generations  ； 
(2) to explore  and  promote  new  approaches  for tackling  and  solving  in an appropriate  way  the problems 
posed  by the health  education  of mothers,  children  and  young  people  in order  to take  care  of their  health 
and of their  protection  against  the harmful  factors  of modern  life; 
(3) to support  actively  the basic  right  to health  of the child  and  the adolescent  and  to promote  by suitable 
means  the improvement  of the legislative  provisions,  together  with  other  concrete  actions  aimed  at ensuring  a healthy  future  for the rising  generations  ； 
(4) to invite  other  international  organizations,  particulary  UNESCO  and  UNICEF,  and,  through  the 
governments  of the Member  countries,  national  health  agencies,  voluntary  organizations  and  parents, 
to participate  actively  in the implementation  of activities  for the health  education  of children  and  young 
people.
