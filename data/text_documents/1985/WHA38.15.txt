HEALTH CONDITIONS  OF THE ARAB POPULATION  IN THE OCCUPIED  ARAB TERRITORIES, 
INCLUDING  PALESTINE 
The Thirty-eighth  World Health Assembly, 
Mindful of the basic principle  established  in the WHO Constitution,  which affirms  that 
the health of all peoples  is fundamental  to the attainment  of peace and security； 
Aware of its responsibility  for ensuring  proper health conditions  for all peoples  who 
suffer from exceptional  situations,  including  foreign  occupation  and especially  settler 
colonialism; 
Affirming  the principle  that the acquisition  of territories  by force is inadmissible  and 
that any occupation  of territories  by force gravely  affects  the health,  social psychological, 
mental and physical  conditions  of the people under occupation,  and that this can be rectified 
only by the complete  and immediate  termination  of the occupation; 
Considering  that the States parties  to the Geneva Convention  of 12 August 1949 pledged 
themselves,  under Article  One thereof,  not only to respect  the Convention  but also to ensure 
that it was respected  in all circumstances； 
Recalling  United Nations  General  Assembly  resolutions  39/49, 39/95 and 39/169 as well as 
all other United Nations  resolutions  relative  to the questions  of Palestine  and the Middle 
East; 
Mindful of the struggle  that the Palestinian  people,  led by the Palestine  Liberation 
Organization,  their sole legitimate  representative,  have waged for their rights to 
self-determination,  to return to their homeland  and to establish  their independent  State in 
Palestine； 
Reiterating  the support  to this struggle  expressed  in many resolutions  of the United 
Nations and other international  institutions  and organizations  that call for the immediate 
and unconditional  withdrawal  of Israel from the occupied  Arab territories,  including 
Palestine； 
Taking note of the report of the Special  Committee  of Experts;^ 
Considering  the right of the peoples  to organize  for themselves  the provision  of their 
own health and social services； 
1. REAFFIRMS  resolutions  WHA37.26,  WHA36.27  and previous  relevant  resolutions  of the World 
Health Assembly；

2. CONDEMNS  Israel for its continuing  occupation,  its arbitrary  practices  against  the Arab 
population,  and its continuing  establishment  of Israeli  settlements  in the Arab Occupied 
Territories,  including  Palestine  and the Golan; and for its illegal  exploitation  of the 
natural wealth and resources  of the Arab inhabitants  in those territories,  especially  the 
appropriation  of water resources  and their diversion  for the purpose  of occupation  and 
settlement,  all of which have devastating  and long-term  effects  on the mental and physical 
health conditions  of the population  under occupation; 
3. CONDEMNS  Israel for its policy aiming at making the population  of the Occupied  Arab 
Territories,  including  Palestine  and the Golan, dependent  on the Israeli  health system,  by 
hindering  the normal course and development  of the Arab health institutions,  as part of 
Israel1s  overall  plan of annexation  of those territories； 
4. CONDEMNS  Israel for continuously  raising  obstacles  to the implementation  of resolution 
WHA36.27,  sub-paragraph  8(2), which requests  the establishment  of three health centres  in the 
occupied  Arab territories,  including  Palestine,  under the direct supervision  of WHO; 
5. DEMANDS  an immediate  end to occupation,  violence  and repression,  and to the 
establishment  of new settlements；  also demands  that those settlements  already  established  be 
dismantled,  in order to enable the Palestinian  people to exercise  its inalienable  national 
rights, as a prerequisite  to the establishment  of a social and health system that would be 
able to ensure health for all by the year 2000; 
6. THANKS  the Director-General  for his efforts  to implement  sub-paragraph  8(2) of 
resolution  WHA36.27  and requests  that he pursue these efforts  until the full implementation 
of this resolution  and submit a report to the Thirty-ninth  World Health Assembly； 
1• REAFFIRMS  the right of the Palestinian  people to have its own institutions  which provide 
medical and social services,  and requests  the Director-General； 
(1) to collaborate  and coordinate  further  with the Arab States concerned  and with the 
Palestine  Liberation  Organization  regarding  the provision  of the necessary  assistance  to 
the Palestinian  people; 
(2) to help the Palestinian  people and their health institutions  to promote  primary 
health care inside and outside  the occupied  Palestinian  territories,  by developing 
sufficient  health and social services,  and the training  of the health personnel,  in 
order to reach health for all by the year 2000; 
(3) to monitor  the health conditions  of the Arab population  in the occupied  Arab 
territories,  including  Palestine,  and report regularly  to the Health Assembly; 
8. THANKS  the Special  Committee  of Experts  for its report and requests  it to continue  its 
task with respect  to all the implications  of occupation  and the policies  of the occupying 
Israeli authorities  and their various  practices  which adversely  affect the health conditions 
of the Arab inhabitants  in the occupied  Arab territories,  including  Palestine,  both 
physically  and psychologically,  and to report to the Thirty-ninth  World Health Assembly,  in 
coordination  with the Arab States concerned  and the Palestine  Liberation  Organization.
