2 Bearing in mind the adverse effects of the conti nued closure of the Palestinian territory on the 
health sector, particularly the children who have been prevented from receiving vaccination for over 
20 months, leading to high risk of infectious  diseases and epidemics among children, whereas 
vaccination and immunization against infectious disea ses constitute a basic right of every child in the 
world; 
Noting with deep anxiety and concern the deteri oration resulting from the excessive use of force 
by the Israeli occupation forces against civilians, including medical teams and its negative impact on 
health programmes, especially on mother-and-ch ild related programmes, vaccination, reproductive 
health, family planning, epidemic control, schoo l health, control of drinking-water safety, insect 
control, mental health and health education;

Palestinian territory which has become a serious threat  to the Palestinian health system, aggravated by 
the withholding by Israel of funds due to the Pales tinian Authority, including health insurance income; 
Affirming that the risks menacing public health are increasing as a result of the Israeli military 
incursions in the occupied Palestinian territories,  imposition of closures and curfews on various areas, 
the refusal by Israel to honour the payment of taxes due to the Palestinian National Authority, the need 
to secure the resources necessary for assuring basic n eeds, prevention of every access to places such as 
education premises, markets and medical clinics,  the decrease in the level of vaccinations, the 
complications imposed on patients suffering fro m chronic diseases such as cardiovascular conditions, 
cancer or kidney problems; 
Affirming that the Israeli occupation prevents acc ess of the Palestinian people to basic services, 
including health services; 
Affirming that the current situation in the occ upied Palestinian territories undermines efforts to 
maintain public health and enda ngers people’s security; and furthermore that its consequences will 
certainly have an adverse effect on public health;

regions under the control of the Palestinian Author ity and for the Arab populations in the occupied 
territories, including Palestinians and the population in the occupied Syrian Golan;

Having considered the reports on health conditions of, and assistan ce to, the Arab population in 
the occupied Arab territories, including Palestin e, particularly the Director-General’s report,1
