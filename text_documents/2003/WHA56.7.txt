eradication campaign 
 
The Fifty-sixth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on Pan African t setse and trypanosomiasis eradication campaign;1 
Acknowledging that pain, suffering and death from trypanosomiasis are a daily threat to more 
than 60 million people in 37 countries of sub- Saharan Africa, 22 of which are among the least 
developed countries; 
Realizing that trypanosomiasis, which causes an estimated annual loss of US$ 4.5 thousand 
million, is one of Africa’s greatest constraints to  socioeconomic development, severely affecting 
human and livestock health, limiting land use, causi ng poverty, and perpetuating underdevelopment on 
the African continent; 
Noting that eradication of tsetse flies would significantly contribute to increasing human wellbeing and productivity of crops and livestock and to reducing rural poverty on the African continent; 
Noting further that a multisectoral approach to  tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis eradication 
programmes has in the past been successful in  drastically reducing both bovine and human 
trypanosomiasis; 
Realizing, therefore, that eradication of tset se flies, which transmit the disease to both humans 
and animals, is the only effective, long-term solution to fight the disease; 
Recognizing decisions AHG/156 (XXXVI) of 12 July 2000 and AHG/169 (XXXVII) of 11 July 
2001 by the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)2 to free 
Africa of tsetse flies, and their endorsement of and commitment to OAU’s Plan of Action for the Pan 
African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC); 
Aware that the Secretary-General of the Unite d Nations in his report to the United Nations 
Economic and Social Council on 25 July 2001 ac knowledged the problem of trypanosomiasis and
