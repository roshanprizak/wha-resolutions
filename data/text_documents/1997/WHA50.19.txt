towards  a public  health  approach  to violence  prevention  based  on scientific  data; 
Recognizing  the opportunities  to give  effect  to the plan  of action  through  the collaborative  mechanisms

3. Bullying  in schools  and in institutions,  and various  forms  of organized  violence;

socioeconomic  factors; 
Reiterating  WHO's  role of leadership  and guidance  to Member  States  in assessing  the problem  of violence
