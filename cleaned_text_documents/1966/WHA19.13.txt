The Nineteenth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Director-General on the development of the malaria eradication programme; 1 Noting that, during 1965, only one additional country has embarked upon an eradication programme; Recognizing that the advance towards malaria eradication has been slower than had been hoped for and that, in several countries, areas have had tobe moved back from the consolidation phase to the attack phase; Believing that deficiencies in planning and management and shortage of material means will continue tobe major hindrances to better programmes, and that, although technical problems exist, administrative failures and financial difficulties frequently contribute to them by delaying full implementation of attack or consolidation operations; Believing further that a flexible approach in the financing of programmes is essential for effectively dealing with technical, administrative and operational problems; Appreciating, however, that additional areas are now in the maintenance and consolidation phases and that two more countries have been entered in the WHO official register of areas where eradication has been achieved ; and Recognizing that the success of the world-wide malaria eradication programme depends, first, on the sustained effort of governments to pursue their eradication activities to final achievement and to maintain the vigilance necessary to prevent the re-establishment of malaria, and, secondly, on the continued assistance of multilateral and bilateral agencies, 1. URGES governments of countries that have not yet embarked on malaria eradication to intensify plans for nation-wide malaria programmes so that malaria eradication maybe achieved as quickly as possible; 2. URGES governments of countries where eradication programmes are already in operation to undertake regular annual critical appraisals of their programmes and to review and revise their detailed plans of action where found necessary to meet changing situations and to overcome technical or administrative difficulties; 3. REQUESTS governments to take early steps to establish those basic health services which area prerequisite for eradication, if not already available; 4. REQUESTS the Director-General : (7) to provide, on request, technical advice and assistance for these appraisals; (6) to take all measures to intensify, within the general framework of the financing of the malaria eradication programme and without impeding operations in the field, the total work and research carried on, particularly that of an immunological, entomological and chemotherapeutic nature, with a view to making the antimalaria campaign more effective in problem areas or in those where transmission still exists; and (c) to pay special attention to the analysis of the position of the world-wide malaria eradication programme and to study the possibilities for its future development; 5. REQUESTS the Director-General to increase the Organization's efforts to obtain material assistance with a view to building health infrastructure and to improving programme effectiveness and, in addition, to intensify assistance for the training of national personnel; and 6. URGES governments and the supporting multilateral and bilateral agencies to continue to accord priority to pre-eradication and eradication programmes so that all such activities maybe accelerated as far as practicable, and to initiate help to those countries where no such help is at present being given.
