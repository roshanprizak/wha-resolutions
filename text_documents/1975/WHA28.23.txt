WHA28.23  Study  of the possibility  of financing  WHO  activities  in currencies  other  than  US dollars  and  Swiss 
francs 
The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly， 
Considering  that,  in accordance  with  Financial  Regulation  5.5,  “Annual  contributions  and  advances  to 
the Working  Capital  Fund  shall  be assessed  in US dollars,  and  shall  be paid  in either  US dollars  or Swiss 
francs;  provided  that  payment  of the whole  or part  of these  contributions  may  be made  in such  other  currency 
or currencies  as the Director-General,  in consultation  with  the Board,  shall  have  determined"; 
Recalling  resolution  WHA2.58  of the Second  World  Health  Assembly,  which  established  the principle 
that all Member  governments  shall  have  equal  rights  in paying  a proportionate  share  of their  contribution 
in such  currencies  as may  be acceptable; 
Taking  into  account  resolution  EB39.R30  as well  as earlier  resolutions  of the World  Health  Assembly 
and the Executive  Board  on the currencies  of payment  of contributions; 
Noting  that  the Working  Group  on Currency  Instability  established  by the General  Assembly  of the 
United  Nations  has  found  no generally  agreed  alternatives  to policies  already  being  utilized  in the United 
Nations  and  related  agencies  in order  to solve  the problems  faced  by the organizations  as a result  of continuing  currency  instability  and  inflation, 
1. DECIDES  that  the present  arrangements  for payment  of contributions  in currencies  other  than  US dollars 
or Swiss  francs,  as established  in resolution  EB39.R30,  should  be continued;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to continue  to collaborate  as appropriate  in any future  interorganizational 
studies  or consultations  concerning  possible  solutions  to the  budgetary  problems  resulting  from  currency 
instability  and  to report  thereon  to the Executive  Board  and  the Health  Assembly.
