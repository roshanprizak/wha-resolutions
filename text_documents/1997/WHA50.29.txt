Agenda  item  20 13  May  1997 
Elimination  of lymphatic  filariasis 
as a public  health  problem 
The Fiftieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Deeply  concerned  at the widening  spread  and increased  distribution  of lymphatic  filariasis  throughout  the 
world  in both  urban  and rural  areas  and concerned  that  it affects  all ages  and both  sexes; 
Appreciating  with  grave  concern  the human  suffering,  social  stigma  and costs  to society  associated  with 
lymphatic  filariasis  morbidity; 
Recognizing  that  there  is a general  lack  of awareness  concerning  this  disease  and its impact  on health 
status,  and that  there  are insufficient  data  on its prevalence  and distribution; 
Welcoming  the recent  studies  which  have  defined  new,  simplified,  highly  effective  strategies; 
Acknowledging  that  an international  task  force  on disease  eradication  has recently  identified  lymphatic 
filariasis  as one of only  six "potentially  eradicable"  infectious  diseases, 
1 • URGES  Member  States: 
(1) to  take  advantage  of recent  advances  in the understanding  of lymphatic  filariasis  and the new 
opportunities  for its elimination  by developing  national  plans  leading  to its elimination,  as well  as for the 
monitoring  and evaluation  of programme  activities; 
(2) to  strengthen  local  programmes  and their  integration  with  the control  of other  diseases,  particularly 
at the community  level,  in order  to implement  simple,  affordable,  acceptable  and sustainable  activities 
based  on community-wide  treatment  strategies,  but supplemented  where  feasible  by vector  control  and 
improved  sanitation; 
(3) to  strengthen  training,  research,  diagnostic  laboratory,  disease  and data  management  capabilities 
in order  to improve  clinical,  epidemiological  and  operational  activities  directed  toward  eliminating 
lymphatic  filariasis  as a public  health  problem; 
(4) to  mobilize  support  of all relevant  sectors,  affected  communities  and nongovernmental  organizations 
for the elimination  of the disease; 世界術生大會决議  iL-^UJ»：^^;^」^；
