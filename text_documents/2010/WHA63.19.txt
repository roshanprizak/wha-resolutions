Agenda item 11.4 21 May 2010 
WHO HIV/AIDS strategy for 2011–2015 
 
The Sixty-third World Health Assembly, 
Considering that the HIV epidemic still constitutes one of the foremost challenges to health and 
development, both in countries with generalized epidemics and in regi ons with concentrated epidemics 
affecting most at-risk groups, such as men who have  sex with men, sex workers and injecting drug 
users; 
Noting that globally HIV is the major cause of  mortality among women of reproductive age and 
was responsible for the death of 280 000 children in  2008, thereby undermining efforts to achieve 
Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5; 
Recognizing that the significant gains made in pr evention and treatment of HIV/AIDS need to 
be sustained and expanded for Mille nnium Development Goal 6 to be  achieved, including the urgent 
need to strengthen targeted prevention measure s and achieve universal access to antiretroviral 
treatment, within a framework of respect for hu man rights, gender equality, and the reduction of 
stigma and discrimination; 
Further recognizing the need to strengthen the linkages between prevention and treatment of 
HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health in order to achieve Millennium Deve lopment Goals 4 and 5; 
Recalling that WHO’s work on HIV/AIDS has been  guided by a series of strategies endorsed by 
several World Health Assemblies, including resolutions WHA53.14, WHA56.30, WHA59.12 and WHA59.19; 
Considering that the WHO “3 by 5” strate gy, launched in 2003, which focused on expanding 
access to antiretroviral treatment, was developed in th e context of the Global Heath Sector Strategy for 
HIV/AIDS (2003–2007), endorsed by the Fifty-sixth World Health Assembly (WHA56.30); 
Recalling that in 2006 the UN adopted the target  of Universal Access  to HIV prevention, 
treatment and care by 2010, and WHO developed the Universal Access Plan 2006–2010, welcomed by 
the Fifty-ninth World Health Assembly, which has guided WHO’s work sin ce then; keeping in mind 
the outcomes of the Second Independent Evaluation of UNAIDS (2009); 
Recognizing the need for countries to sustain commitment to addressing the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic at all levels, including the highest political level, and to be supported in their efforts to 
expand the scope, improve the effectiveness and ensure  the sustainability of their HIV responses so as 
to enable them to achieve th e Millennium Development Goals; WHA63.19 
 
 
  
 
 
2 Noting that a sustainable HIV response requires its integration into comprehensive health 
systems, including those for maternal, neonatal and child health, sexual and reproductive health, 
tuberculosis prevention and contro l, harm reduction for drug users,1 and primary health care, 
particularly noting that sustaining these efforts is ch allenging in light of the global financial crisis; 
Recognizing that antiretroviral treatment programm es take a major share of total national AIDS 
spending in most countries, which warrants imme diate attention to review and improve the 
performance of those programmes through early recruitment, ensuring highest adherence to 
medications, limiting drug resistan ce, and minimizing risk behavi ours and enhancing the level of 
national spending on HIV prevention and control measures; 
Expressing deep concern that the financing of HIV programmes in most developing countries 
relies on external financial resources contributed by donors and global health initiatives, with space for 
improvement in their adherence to aid effectiveness commitments; limited national financial resources, hamper the financial sustainability of HIV programmes, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to reaffirm their commitment to achieve th e internationally agreed development goals and 
objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the goal to halt and 
begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other major diseases and to the 
agreements dealing with HIV/AIDS reached at all major United Nations conferences and 
summits, including the 2005 World Summit and its  statement on treatment, and the goal of 
achieving universal access to reproductive health  by 2015, as set out at the 2005 World Summit; 
(1bis) to increase governments’ commitment to HIV/AIDS programmes including increased 
efforts on prevention and to take steps to accel erate donor harmonization and adherence to aid 
effectiveness commitments; 
(2) to incorporate, based on national contex ts, the policies, strategies, programmes and 
interventions and tools recommended by WHO in order to implement effective HIV prevention 
measures, early diagnosis, treatment and care; and take further steps towards minimizing social 
stigmatization and discrimination which hamper  access to prevention, treatment and care; 
(3) to consider, whenever necessary, using ex isting administrative and legal mechanisms in 
order to promote access to affordable and co st-effective prevention, treatment and care; 
(4) to integrate HIV/AIDS services into comprehe nsive strategies in health and other relevant 
sectors, including those for maternal, neonatal and child health, sexual and reproductive health, 
tuberculosis, harm reduction
1 and primary health care, in order to ensure sustainability and 
maximize efficiencies and effectiveness; 
(5) to monitor closely and evaluate HIV/AI DS programmes by ensuring the completeness, 
accuracy and reliability of the data and use that  information to improve programme efficiency;

  3  2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to take the lead in convening broad cons ultative processes to develop a WHO HIV/AIDS 
strategy for 2011–2015 which will guide the Secret ariat’s support to Member  States in line with 
UNAIDS guiding policies, including the Outcome Framework1 and aligned with broader 
strategic frameworks, including the Millennium Development Goals and primary health care, 
and which builds on the five strategic directions  of the Universal Access Plan, and takes into 
consideration the changing international public health architecture, and reflect the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness; 
(2) to encourage and promote the translation of  research results into efficient public health 
policies for HIV/AIDS; 
(3) to submit to the Sixty-fourth World H ealth Assembly through the Executive Board a 
WHO HIV/AIDS strategy for 2011–2015 for its  consideration and possible endorsement.
