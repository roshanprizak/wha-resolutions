HEALTH FOR ALL BY THE YEAR 2000 
The Thirty-seventh  World Health Assembly, 
Reaffirming  resolutions  WHA30.43,  WHA34.36  and WHA35.23  concerning  the policy,  strategy 
and plan of action for attaining  the goal of health for all by the year 2000； 
Recalling  resolution  WHA33.17  concerning  the concentration  of the Organization1s 
activities  on support  for the attainment  of this goal； 
Noting that the attainment  of the goal of health for all by the year 2000 is intimately 
related to socioeconomic  development  and commitment  to and the preservation  of world peace; 
Recognizing  the determination  of all countries  to contribute  fully to achieving  the goal 
of health for all through  reinforcement  of individual  and collective  self-reliance,  of which 
technical  cooperation  among developing  countries  is an essential  element; 
Aware that cooperation  among all countries  and support  by developed  countries  and 
international  organizations,  including  the principles  of a new international  economic  order, 
can significantly  contribute  to a more rational  use of available  resources; 
Recognizing  that monitoring  and evaluation  are fundamental  elements  of the managerial 
process required  for the implementation  of the strategies,  and that the commitment  and 
courage of Member States and a spirit of mutual trust among them are essential  for the 
effective  implementation  of the Strategy  for Health for All； 
Mindful that only three-quarters  of the Member States have submitted  progress  reports  in 
due time on the implementation  of their national  strategies； 
Noting the progress  made thus far in the implementation  of the Strategy,  but also being 
aware of the magnitude  of the overall  task and the relatively  short period left to achieve 
the collectively  agreed goal of health for all by the year 2000；

process ; 
(2) to accord the highest  priority  to and assume full responsibility  for the continuing

the Strategy;

these resources  are adequately  directed  towards  underserved  and socially  and 
geographically  disadvantaged  groups；
