The Forty-fifth World Health Assembly, Noting with concern that, as at 31 December 1991: (1) the rate of collection in 1991 of contributions to the effective working budget amounted to 81.85%, leaving US$ 55 673 594 of 1991 contributions unpaid; (2) only 90 Members had paid their 1991 contributions to the effective working budget in full, and 50 Members had made no payment, 1. EXPRESSES concern at the level of outstanding contributions, which has had a deleterious effect on the financial situation; 2. CALLS THE ATTENTION of all Members to Financial Regulation 5.6, which provides that instalments of contributions and advances shall be considered as due and payable in full by the first day of the year to which they relate, and to the importance of paying contributions as early as possible to enable the DirectorGeneral to implement the programme budget in an orderly manner; 3. REMINDS Members that, as a result of the adoption, by resolution WHA41.12, of an incentive scheme to promote the timely payment of assessed contributions, those that pay their assessed contributions for 1991 and 1992 early in the year to which they relate will have their contributions payable for the 1994-1995 programme budget reduced appreciably, while those paying later will have their contributions payable for the 1994-1995 programme budget reduced only marginally or not at all; 4. URGES Members that are regularly late in the payment of their contributions to take as rapidly as possible all steps necessary to ensure prompt and regular payment; 5. NOTES that unless the situation improves it may become necessary to increase the authorized level of the Working Capital Fund; 6. REQUESTS the Director-General to draw this resolution to the attention of all Members. Eleventh plenary meeting, 11 May 1992 A45 / VR / 11
