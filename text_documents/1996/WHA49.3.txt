FORTY-NINTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA49.3 
Agenda  item  20.2  23  May  1996 
Status  of collection  of assessed 
contributions 
The Forty-ninth  World Health Assembly, 
Noting with concern that, as at 31 December  1995: 
(a) the rate of collection  in 1995 of contributions  to the effective  working  budget for that year 
amounted  to 56.31%,  the lowest collection  rate in WHO history,  leaving US$ 177 293 158 unpaid in 
respect of 1995 contributions; 
(b) only 96 Members  had paid their contributions  to the effective  working budget for that year in 
full, and 78 Members  had made no payment; 
(c) total unpaid contributions  in respect of 1995 and prior years exceeded  US$ 243 million, 
1. EXPRESSES  deep concern at the unprecedented  level of outstanding  contributions,  which has had a 
deleterious  effect on programmes  and on the financial  situation; 
2. CALLS  THE ATTENTION  of all Members  to Financial  Regulation  5.6, which provides  that 
instalments  of contributions  shall be considered  as due and payable in full by the first day of the year to 
which they relate, and to the importance  of paying contributions  as early as possible to enable the DirectorGeneral to implement  the programme  budget in an orderly manner; 
3. REMINDS  Members  that, as a result of the adoption,  by resolution  WHA41.12,  of an incentive  scheme 
to promote the timely payment  of assessed contributions,  those that pay their assessed contributions  early in 
the year in which they are due will have their contributions  payable for a subsequent  programme  budget 
reduced appreciably,  whereas Members  paying later will have their contributions  payable for that subsequent 
programme  budget reduced only marginally  or not at all; 
4. URGES  Members  that are regularly  late in the payment of their contributions  to take immediate  steps 
to ensure prompt and regular payment; 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to review, taking into account developments  in other organizations 
of the United Nations system, all additional  measures  that may be appropriate  to the circumstances  of WHO 
with a view to ensuring  a sound financial  basis for the implementation  of programmes,  and to report on this 
matter to the ninety-ninth  session of the Executive  Board and the Fiftieth World Health Assembly; 
WHA49.3 
6. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to draw this resolution  to the attention  of all Members.
