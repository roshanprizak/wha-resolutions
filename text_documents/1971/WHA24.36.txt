WHA24.36  Disinsection  of aircraft 
The Twenty-fourth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on the investigations  which  are being  carried  out 
on a vapour  disinsection  system; 
Commending  the  effort  which  has  been  made  to resolve  the technical  problems  involved;  and 
Recognizing  that  the final  report  will  not be available  until  the current  series  of tests  has been  completed, 
1. DECIDES  that  the effective  date  for implementation  of a vapour  disinsection  system  be further  postponed 
until  such  time  as the tests  have  been  completed  and  the  technical  problems  resolved;  and 
2. REITERATES  the recommendation  to Member  States  as contained  in resolution  WHA23.58  that  in the 
interim  period  the  " blocks-away  " disinsection  method  and  aerosol  disinsection  on the  ground  on arrival 
be the approved  methods  for aircraft  disinsection  and  that  every  effort  be made  by health  administrations  to 
ensure  that  during  this  interim  period  the " blocks-away  " method  is applied  effectively.
