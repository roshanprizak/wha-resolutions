FORTY-EIGHTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA48.12 
Agenda  item  19 12  May  1995 
Control  of diarrhoeal  diseases  and 
acute  respiratory  infections:  integrated 
management  of the sick  child 
The Forty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA40.34  and  WHA44.7  concerning  the strengthening  of national  programmes 
for the prevention  and  case  management  of diarrhoeal  diseases  and acute  respiratory  infections  in children; 
Mindful  of the target  for reduction  of infant  and child  mortality  rates  by the year  2000  set at the World 
Summit  for Children  in 1990，and  of WHO's  commitment  to ensuring  survival  and  healthy  development  of 
children,  as reflected  in the Ninth  General  Programme  of Work; 
Noting  with  appreciation  the progress  made  in the implementation  of national  programmes  for control 
of diarrhoeal  diseases  and  acute  respiratory  infections  and  the effect  they  are likely  to have  in the global 
reduction  of mortality  in children  under  five  years  of age; 
Concerned,  however,  at the fact that diarrhoeal  diseases  and acute  respiratory  infections  remain  the two 
major  causes  of child  mortality,  accounting,  together  with  malaria,  measles  and malnutrition,  for seven  out 
of 10 deaths  in children  less  than  five  years  of age in the developing  world; 
Considering,  also,  that  significantly  intensified  efforts  and increased  resources  at global  level  will  be 
needed  to meet  the end-of-decade  goals  for reduction  of child  mortality; 
Noting  that  WHO  has pioneered  research  and the development  of guidelines  and training  materials  for 
integrated  case  management  of major  childhood  illness  at first-level  health  facilities; 
Recognizing  that  UNICEF,  agencies  for bilateral  cooperation  and  national  research  institutions  in 
developed  and  developing  countries  have  committed  themselves  to supporting  the WHO  research  and 
development  initiative  on the integrated  management  of childhood  illness, 
1. ENDORSES  the integrated  management  of the sick  child  as a more  cost-effective  approach  to ensuring 
the survival  and  healthy  development  of children; 
2. URGES  governments  of countries  which  have  not yet reached  the infant  and child  mortality  reduction 
targets  for the year  2000: 
WHA48.12 
(1) to  accelerate  and  sustain  the programmes  for control  of diarrhoeal  disease  and acute  respiratory 
infections  in order  to reach  the target  of reduction  of infant  and child  mortality  rates  by the year  2000; 
(2) to  apply  existing  technical  guidelines  for the integrated  management  of the sick  child,  and to plan 
for the transition  from  specific  programmes  against  childhood  diseases  to an integrated  approach  to 
illness  in children  with  continued  efforts  to prevent  sickness  among  young  children,  using,  where 
available,  all the primary  health  care  development  logistics; 
(3) to  strengthen  the existing  health  system  mechanisms  for disease  prevention,  in-service  training, 
logistics,  communication,  supervision,  monitoring  and  evaluation  in order  to provide  a solid  basis  for 
the integrated  management  of the sick  child; 
(4) to  strengthen  and  maintain  managerial  activities  for the prevention  and  control  of diarrhoea  and 
acute  respiratory  infections  and activities  to tackle  the underlying  problems  of malnutrition  in children 
during  the transition  to the integrated  approach; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to  continue  the development  of managerial  tools  including  technical  guidelines,  planning  guides, 
training  courses,  communication  materials,  and  manuals  for the planning,  supervision,  monitoring  and 
evaluation  of national  activities  for integrated  management  of the sick  child; 
(2) to  promote  the prevention  of the major  causes  of child  mortality; 
(3) to  promote,  coordinate  and support  research  and development  on activities  to overcome  technical 
and operational  problems  arising  during  the  development  of managerial  tools  and  the  initial 
implementation  of the integrated  management  of the sick  child; 
(4) to  facilitate  the  provision  of tools  for  prevention  of acute  respiratory  infections  such  as 
Haemophilus  influenza  В vaccine  and  a conjugate  pneumococcal  for  vaccination  of children  in 
developing  countries; 
(5) to  promote  the rational  use of antimicrobials  as an essential  element  of the integrated  management 
of the sick  child  and  to monitor  the evolution  and  antimicrobial  resistance  of the main  causative 
organisms  of the major  infectious  diseases  of children,  in close  coordination  with  the Organization's 
efforts  in relation  to new,  emerging  and  re-emerging  infectious  diseases; 
(6) to  cooperate  with  Member  States  in formulating  technical  guidelines,  based  on the WHO 
managerial  tools,  for the planning  and implementation  of national  activities  for integrated  management 
of the sick  child; 
(7) to  maintain  close  and effective  collaboration  with  other  interested  agencies  and organizations,  in 
particular  UNICEF,  UNDP  and the World  Bank,  to promote  the concept  and practice  of the integrated 
management  of the sick  child; 
(8) to  step  up the search  for the extrabudgetary  funds  required  for the implementation  of this 
initiative; 
(9) to  keep  the Executive  Board  and  the Health  Assembly  informed  of the progress  made,  as 
appropriate.
