Recalling the political declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage entitled Universal health coverage: moving together to build a healthier world including the commitment to further strengthen efforts to address noncommunicable diseases as part of universal health coverage, and the recognition that peoples engagement, particularly that of women and girls, families and communities, and the inclusion of all relevant stakeholders is one of the core components of health system governance, to fully empower all people in improving and protecting their own health; Recalling also the political declaration of the third high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases including the commitment to promote access to affordable diagnostics, screening, treatment and care, as well as vaccines that lower the risk of cancer, including cervical cancer, as part of the comprehensive approach to its prevention and control; Recalling further decision EB144(2) (2019), in which the Executive Board noted that urgent action is needed to scale up implementation of proven cost-effective measures towards achieving the elimination of cervical cancer as a global public health problem, including vaccination against human papillomavirus, screening and treatment of pre-cancer, early detection and prompt treatment of early invasive cancers, and palliative care, which will require political commitment and greater international cooperation and support for equitable access, including strategies for resource mobilization;

Deeply concerned by the significant burden of mortality and morbidity from cervical cancer and the associated suffering and stigma experienced by women, families and communities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and concerned by the disproportionate burden in remote and hard-to-reach areas, on marginalized communities or those in vulnerable situations, and on women and girls living with HIV, who are more likely to develop cervical cancer; Recognizing the importance of a holistic health systems approach to cervical cancer prevention and control, integrating vaccination programmes, screening and treatment programmes, adolescent health services, HIV and sexual and reproductive health services, and communicable disease and noncommunicable disease health services, as well as the importance of inclusive and strategic national, regional and global partnerships that extend beyond the health sector; Welcoming the prioritization of vaccination of girls against human papillomavirus as the most effective long-term intervention for reducing the risk of developing cervical cancer, and recognizing the critical importance of strengthening vaccine supply and access, including by improving affordability and reducing prices to facilitate the inclusion of the human papillomavirus vaccine in national immunization programmes; Recognizing the urgent need to implement and scale up cervical cancer screening and treatment programmes to reduce incidence and mortality, and the urgent need to increase research and collaboration to develop cost-effective and innovative interventions for vaccination, screening, diagnosis, treatment and care in respect of cervical cancer, which could greatly increase the availability, affordability and accessibility of such interventions, 1. ADOPTS the global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem and its associated goals and targets for the period 20202030;1 2. URGES Member States2 to implement the interventions recommended in the global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem, adapted to national contexts and priorities, and embedded in strong health systems aimed at achieving universal health coverage; 3.
