Agenda item 13.6 21 May 2001
Scaling up the response to HIV/AIDS
The Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly,
Taking into consideration the report on HIV/AIDS; 1
Recognizing that AIDS is a crisis of unprecedented proportions that threatens development,
social cohesion, political stability, life expectancy and places a devastating burden on many countriesand regions;
Recalling that the Constitution of the World Health Organization states that enjoyment of the
highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being withoutdistinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition, and considering that
progressive realization of that right in the context of HIV/AIDS, should involve access, on a nondiscriminatory basis to health facilities, prevention, care, treatment and support;
Considering that stigmatization, silence, discrimination and denial aggravate the impact of the
pandemic;
Acknowledging that all countries must continue to emphasize widespread and effective
prevention, including education, nutrition, information and services, as well as access to, among other
products, vaccines, condoms, microbicides and drugs;
Recognizing that prevention and care are inextricably linked, and that their effectiveness is
increased when they are used together;
Considering that HIV/AIDS affects women and children with special severity;
Recognizing that inexpensive and effective drugs to prevent and treat opportunistic infections
exist, are urgently needed, and can be made rapidly available;
Acknowledging that the lack of affordable pharmaceuticals and of feasible supply structures and
health systems continues to hinder an effective response to HIV/AIDS in many countries andespecially for the poorest people;
                                                     
1 Document A54/15.WHA54.10
2Recognizing that, where it has been available, antiretroviral therapy has reduced mortality and
prolonged healthy lives, that recent reductions in prices create a new opportunity to extend this benefitto those that would otherwise not be able to afford them;
Noting the critical role that health services and systems must play in delivering or scaling up
delivery of these responses, and that the health systems in many developing countries are already
overstretched by the existing burden of diseases and particularly by the added impact of HIV/AIDS;
Recognizing that in order to implement a comprehensive and multisectoral approach to combat
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases will require adequate human and financialresources at national and international levels;
Taking into account the need to implement measures that incorporate HIV/AIDS prevention,
care and awareness interventions in humanitarian assistance programmes to ensure that populations
affected by conflict, and natural and human disasters – refugees, internally displaced persons and, in
particular, women and children – are protected from and treated appropriately for HIV and related
infections;
Recalling efforts to make drugs available at lower prices for those in need;Welcoming  the work in progress to develop a global AIDS and health fund;
Bearing in mind various regional initiatives, including the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases, of the African Heads of State and Government,
which recognizes that those epidemics should be tackled as an integral part of the agenda forpromoting poverty reduction and sustainable development and the Declaration of Quebec City of the
Heads of State and Governments of the Americas, which emphasizes that good health and equal access
to medical attention, health services and affordable medical drugs are vital for human developmentand for achievement of political, economic and social objectives;
Noting resolutions 2001/33 and 2001/51 adopted by the Commission on Human Rights at its
57th
 session;

national AIDS programmes, the leadership of the United Nations Secretary-General, particularly in the
context of the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on HIV/AIDS (June 2001);

and treatment, organization of services, dissemination of information to support the formulation ofhealth policies, and the improvement of access to affordable drugs and commodities;
