Agenda item 11.7 21 May 2010 
Birth defects 
 
The Sixty-third World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on birth defects;1 
Concerned by the high number of stillbirths and neonatal deaths occurring worldwide and by 
the large contribution of neonatal mortality to under-five mortality; 
Recognizing the importance of birth defects as a cause of stillbirths and neonatal mortality; 
Mindful that effective interventions to prevent birth defects including provision of appropriate 
community genetic services within the primary health  care are available that can be integrated into 
maternal, reproductive and child health services as well as interventions to limit exposure to risk 
factors for birth defects; 
Concerned by the inadequate coverage of matern al, newborn and child health interventions and 
the barriers to access to health servi ces that still exist in countries w ith the highest burden of maternal, 
newborn and child deaths; 
Aware that the attainment of Millennium Deve lopment Goal 4 (Reduce child mortality) will 
require accelerated progress in reducing neonatal mo rtality including prevention and management of 
birth defects; 
Recognizing that the lack or inadequacy of vita l registration systems in developing countries, 
and inaccurate records of the causes of death, are ma jor barriers to estimating the size of public health 
problems attributable to birth defects;  
Recalling resolution WHA58.31, in which the Hea lth Assembly, calling for universal coverage 
of maternal, newborn and child health interventions , urged Member States to commit resources and to 
accelerate national action to build a seamless con tinuum of care for reproductive, maternal, newborn 
and child health; and resolution WHA57.13 in which it was recognized that genomics has a significant 
contribution to make in the area of public health; 
Recognizing that the prevalence of birth de fects varies between communities, and that 
insufficient epidemiological data may hamper effective and equitable management;

2 Recognizing the diversity of causes and determ inants of congenital disorders, including 
preventable factors such as infections or nutritiona l factors, vaccine-preventable diseases, consumption 
of alcohol, tobacco and drugs, and exposure to  chemical substances, notably pesticides; 
Deeply concerned that birth defects are not still recognized as priorities in public health; 
Concerned by the limited resources dedicated to prevention and management of birth defects 
before and after birth in particular in middle- and low-income countries, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to raise awareness among all relevant stakehol ders, including government officials, health 
professionals, civil society and the public, about the importance of birth defects as a cause of 
child morbidity and mortality; 
(2) to set priorities, commit resources, and develop plans and activities for integrating 
effective interventions that include comprehens ive guidance, information and awareness raising 
to prevent birth defects, and care for children with birth defects into existing maternal, 
reproductive and child health services and social  welfare for all individuals and effective 
interventions to prevent tobacco and alcohol use during pregnancy; 
(3) to promote the application of internationa lly recognized standards regulating the use of 
chemical substances in the air, water and soil; 
(4) to increase coverage of effective prevention measures including vaccination against 
rubella, folic acid supplementation, programme addressing tobacco and alcohol use among 
pregnant women and women who are trying to conceive, health education programmes that 
include ethical, legal and social issues associat ed with birth defects for the general population 
and high-risk groups, and by fostering the deve lopment of parent–patient organizations and 
establishing appropriate community genetic services; 
(5) to develop and strengthen registration and surveillance systems for birth defects within 
the framework of national health information sy stems in order to have accurate information 
available for taking decisions on prevention and co ntrol of these birth defects and to continue 
providing care and support to individuals affected by birth defects; 
(6) to develop expertise and to build capacity on the prevention of birth defects and care of 
children with birth defects; 
(7) to strengthen research and studies on etiology, diagnosis and prevention of major birth 
defects and to promote international cooperation in combating with them; 
(8) to raise awareness among all relevant stakehol ders, including government officials, health 
professionals, civil society and the public, about the importance of newborn screening 
programmes and their role in identifying in fants born with congenital birth defects; 
(9) to take all necessary measur es to ensure the full enjoyment by children with disabilities of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an  equal basis with other children and give 
priority to the child’s well-being and support a nd facilitate families in their child-care and childraising efforts;   WHA63.17

ensure that appropriate habi litation and support is provided to children with disabilities; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to promote the collection of data on the global burden of mortality and morbidity due to 
birth defects, and to consider  broadening the groups of conge nital abnormalities included in the 
classification when the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (Tenth Revision) is revised; 
(2) to continue to collaborate with the In ternational Clearinghouse for Birth Defects 
Surveillance and Research in order to improve co llection of data on global burden of mortality 
and morbidity due to birth defects; 
(3) to support Member States in developing national plans for implementation of effective 
interventions to prevent and manage birth def ects within their national maternal, newborn and 
child health plan, strengthening health system s and primary care, incl uding improved coverage
