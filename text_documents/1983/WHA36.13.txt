13 May 1983 
INTERNATIONAL  DRINKING  WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION  DECADE 
The Thirty-sixth  World Health Assembly, 
Noting with appreciation  the report^"  of the Director-General  relating  to 
International  Drinking  Water Supply and Sanitation  Decade (1981-1990)； the 
Recalling  resolution  WHA34.25  and particularly  its emphasis  on the Decade approach  and 
its recommendation  to Member States that they concentrate  water supply and sanitation 
programmes  on their priority  health problems； 
Noting with concern  that, despite  the progress  made, including  the increased  external 
technical  and financial  support,  with almost a quarter  of the Decade already  gone, countries 
are encountering  difficulties  in achieving  the goals they and the Decade have set and in 
accelerating  their Decade programmes； 
Considering  that in this respect  the national  health agencies  have a special  role to 
play in promoting  the Decade and in contributing  to the attainment  of its aims as part of 
primary health care activities,  and particularly  the training  and use of community-based 
workers,  health education  and public information,  and the strengthening  of the health 
infrastructure； 
Noting that, despite  the general  acknowledgement  of the importance  of intersectoral 
cooperation  and action,  many national  and international  agencies  have not yet taken steps 
to introduce  the changes  of approach  that the Decade requires  ； 
Recognizing  that it is essential  to seize now the opportunity  of improving  health 
through the provision  of safe drinking  water supplies  and adequate  sanitation  services  ； 
1. CALLS  for a vigorous  effort by all concerned  to ensure substantial  progress  towards 
the goals of the Decade ； 
2. URGES  Member States to pursue the following  plan of action: 
(1) to accelerate  the adoption  of national  policies  and the drawing-up  of sound 
plans through  which priority  can be given to underserved  urban and rural populations, 
bearing in mind that improved  sanitation  should go hand in hand with the provision  of 
safe water； 
(2) to promote  , as proposed  by the Director-General,  the concept  of safe drinkingwater supply and sanitation  as an essential  component  of primary  health care ； 
(3) to ensure that their national  agencies  take practical  steps and allocate  the 
necessary  resources  and manpower  to implement  the above concept  ；

light of the regional  health-for-all  strategies,  and to propose  measures  that national 
health agencies  can take to ensure the adoption  and implementation  of the abovementioned  national  plans of action,  and to include  relevant  parts of these plans in 
reviews by countries  of the utilization  of resources  for primary  health care； 
(2) to adopt regional  measures  to support  countries  in strengthening  their Decade 
activities； 
4. URGES  the multilateral  and bilateral  agencies  concerned 
(1) to support  health oriented  national  Decade plans in accordance  with resolution 
WHA34.25; 
(2) to participate  in efforts  to coordinate  external  contributions  to Decade

these respects； 
(3) to continue  to cooperate  with multilateral  and bilateral  agencies  by keeping  them

health ； 
(4) to continue  to collaborate  with the other agencies  of the United Nations  system in the
