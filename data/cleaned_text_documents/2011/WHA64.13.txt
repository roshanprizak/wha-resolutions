URGES Member States: (1) to ensure that health authorities in count ries with high perinatal and neonatal mortality rates use their stewardship and leadership to involve other institutions and sectors, to strengthen capacity to achieve a greater reduction in avoidable neonatal and perinatal mortality in the context of improving the continuum of maternal and child health; (2) to further promote political commitment for effective implementation of the existing national, regional and / or global plans with the application of evidence-based strategies and interventions, including the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, to improve perinatal and neonatal health and increase equitable access to quality ma ternal, newborn and child health services; (3) to advance perinatal and neonatal care as apriority and develop, as appropriate, plans for universal access to cost-effective interventions , including actions to address sepsis and nosocomial infections, information and behaviour change communication, skilled birth attendants and early postnatal care and early and exclusive breastfeeding; (4) to strengthen the perinatal and neonatal mortality surveillance system including data and vital statistics collection aswell as moni toring and reporting mechanisims; 2. REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to continue to raise awareness within the international community about the global burden of perinatal and neonatal mortality and promote, based on current best practices, targeted plans to increase access to high quality and safe health services to prevent and treat perinatal and neonatal conditions within an integrated mother and child health package including reproductive health; (2) to strengthen regional and country level institutional capacity and human resources (including skilled birth attenda nts and essential newborn care, including the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, to identify innovative soluti ons, and promote research to address the main WHA64.13 3 causes of perinatal and neonatal mortality such as prematurity, sepsis, respiratory conditions and infections, in particular of nosocomial origin; (3) to support coordination of actions with WHO relevant entities and United Nations agencies and other stakeholders and strengthen or build partnerships to promote intra and interregional collaboration in order to enhance effectiveness of action in this specific area; (4) to provide Member States with necessary assistance and technical advice to develop and implement national polices, plans and st rategies for the prevention and reduction of perinatal and neonatal mortality, and related maternal morbidity and mortality; (5) to report to the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly on progress achieved in connection with the agenda item concerning the Millennium Development Goals.
