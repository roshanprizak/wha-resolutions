Agenda  item  18 11  May 1992 
DISABILITY  PREVENTION  AND  REHABILITATION 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  by the Director-General  on disability  prevention  and rehabilitation; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA28.54,  WHA29.68,  WHA38.18,  WHA38.19  and WHA42.28; 
Noting  the approach  of the end of the United  Nations  Decade  of Disabled  Persons  (1983-1992); 
Aware  of the global  magnitude  of the disability  problem  and its anticipated  increase  as a result  of 
population  growth  and population  aging,  particularly  in developing  countries; 
Recognizing  the persistent  scarcity  of reliable  data on some  disabling  disorders,  which  impedes  the 
planning  of preventive  and rehabilitative  measures; 
Noting  the progress  that has been  made  in the prevention  of some  conditions  causing  disabilities,  such as 
poliomyelitis,  measles  and infectious  eye diseases; 
Recognizing  the need  to continue  and extend  successful  measures  for prevention  of disabling  conditions 
wherever  feasible,  while  developing  new approaches  to decreasing  or eliminating  other  preventable  disabilities; 
Noting  the constraints  in resources  that limit the expansion  of rehabilitation  services  to meet  current 
needs,  with the result  that the vast majority  of disabled  people  in developing  countries  are without  such 
services; 
Stressing  the importance  of using  the experience  and the gains  achieved  during  the United  Nations 
Decade  of Disabled  Persons  as a basis  for renewing  and expanding  efforts  for prevention  of disability  and for 
rehabilitation, 
1. CALLS  ON Member  States: 
(1) to initiate  or strengthen  comprehensive  national  programmes  for disability  prevention  and 
reíiabilitation  integrated  into primary  health  care,  taking  into account  all physical  and mental  disabilities; 
(2) to strengthen  and coordinate  rehabilitation  services  as a continuum  of primary  and secondary 
prevention; 
(3) to promote  and coordinate  the involvement  of nongovernmental  organizations  in national 
programmes  for disability  prevention  and rehabilitation;

(4) to promote  equality  of opportunity  for the meaningful  participation  of disabled  people  in all 
aspects  of community  life, and the elimination  of physical  barriers  such as those  resulting  from 
architectural  design; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to collaborate  with interested  organizations  in improving  the information  base  and methods  for the 
evaluation  of disability  prevention  and rehabilitation  programmes; 
(2) to continue  to develop  strategies  for the integration  of methods  of disability  prevention  and to 
reinforce  the link between  prevention  and rehabilitation  within  primary  health  care; 
(3) to further  strengthen  collaborative  work  within  the United  Nations  system,  and with 
nongovernmental  organizations  and collaborating  centres,  in disability  prevention  and rehabilitation.
