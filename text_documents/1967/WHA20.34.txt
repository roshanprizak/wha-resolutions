WHA20.34  Quality  Control  of Pharmaceutical  Preparations 
The Twentieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the Director-General  on the  quality  control  of pharmaceutical  preparations; 
Having  noted  resolution  EB39.R8  of the  thirty-ninth  session  of the  Executive  Board  on  the  quality 
control  of pharmaceutical  preparations; 
Noting  that  this  matter  has  been  the  subject  of repeated  discussion  at previous  sessions  of the Executive 
Board  and  the  World  Health  Assembly,  but  that  desirable  results  have  not  yet  been  reached; 
Bearing  in mind  resolution  WHA18.36,  which  invited  governments  to take  the  necessary  measures  to 
subject  pharmaceutical  preparations,  imported  or locally  manufactured,  to adequate  quality  control; 
Recalling  particularly  resolution  WHA  19.47,  requesting  the  Director-General  to establish  generally 
acceptable  principles  for  the  quality  control  of pharmaceutical  preparations,  and  to continue  to assist 
Member  States  in their  efforts  to improve  the  quality  control  of pharmaceutical  preparations  and  to establish 
quality  control  laboratories  for  national  or regional  purposes; 
Noting  with  concern  that  the  requests  to Member  States  that  drugs  should  not  be exported  without 
having  been  subject  to the  same  quality  control  as those  issued  to the  home  market  in the country  of origin 
are not  yet  generally  applied,  and  that  in many  cases  pharmaceutical  preparations  are  continuing  to 
circulate  without  such  control;  and 
Considering  the  measures  outlined  in the  Director-General's  report  on the  improvement  of the  quality 
of drugs  on the  international  level, 
REQUESTS  the  Director-General: 
(i) to formulate  as soon  as possible  principles  for  quality  control  procedures  such  as should  be 
incorporated  in good  drug  manufacturing  practice; 
(ii) to continue  work  on analytical  control  specifications  for  international  acceptance  to be published 
as they  are  completed; 
(iii) to continue  to assist  Member  States  in establishing  or securing  access  to national  or regional 
laboratory  facilities  for  quality  control  of drugs  with  support  where  appropriate  of multilateral  or 
bilateral  assistance; 
(iv) to report  to the  Twenty-first  World  Health  Assembly,  through  the  Executive  Board  and  with  its 
comments,  on the  principles  which  should  be included  in regulations  under  Article  21 of the  Constitution of WHO,  supplemented,  as may  be necessary,  by recommendations  under  Article  23, in regard  to 
pharmaceutical  products  in international  commerce  and  on the  steps  which  the  Organization  would 
have  to take  to implement  the  programme  of work  involved  ; 
(v) to ask  again  countries  which  export  pharmaceuticals  to ensure  that  these  are  subject  to control 
measures  which  will  secure  that  they  comply  with  standards  of quality  not  less  than  those  imposed  on 
domestic  commerce;  and 
(vi) to report  on the financial  implications  for WHO  of any  action  proposed  under  this  resolution.
