WHA31.33  Medicinal  plants 
The Thirty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  the importance  of medicinal  plants  in the health  care  systems  in many  developing  countries  ； 
Noting  the  increasing  awareness  of governments  and  the  scientific  and  medical  communities  of this 
matter  ； 
Considering  that  these  plants  contain  substances  which  may  be of therapeutic  value  but  may  also  possibly  show  potential  toxicity  when  improperly  used  ； 
Realizing  that  the use of medicinal  plants  is likely  to continue  in many  countries  ； 
Noting  with  interest  the efforts  of WHO  to deal  with  this  matter; 
REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to compile  an inventory  of medicinal  plants  used  in the  different  countries,  with  standardized 
botanical  nomenclature  for the ones  most  widely  used; 
(2) to compile  and  periodically  update  a therapeutic  classification  of medicinal  plants,  related  to the 
therapeutic  classification  of all drugs; 
(3) to review  the available  scientific  data  relating  to the efficacy  of medicinal  plants  in the treatment  of 
specific  conditions  and  diseases,  and  make  available  in summary  form  the results  of the review  ； 
(4) to coordinate  the efforts  of Member  States  to : 
{a) develop  and  apply  scientific  criteria  and  methods  for proof  of safety  and  efficacy  of medicinal 
plant  products,  especially  galenicals; 
(b) develop  international  standards  and  specifications  for identity,  purity  and  strength  of medicinal 
plant  products,  especially  galenicals,  and  manufacturing  practices  to achieve  these  ends; 
(c) develop  methods  for the safe  and  effective  use of medicinal  plant  products,  especially  galenicals, 
including  labelling  containing  adequate  directions  for use,  and  criteria  for use  or prescription  by 
various  levels  of health  workers; 
(5) to disseminate  information  on these  matters  among  Member  States; 
(6) to designate  regional  research  and  training  centres  for the study  of medicinal  plants; 
(7) to report  on the subject  to a subsequent  Health  Assembly.
