The Seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  the  decision  of the First  World  Health  Assembly,1  based  on the  recommendation  of the 
Interim  Commission,2  instructing  the Executive  Board  " to establish  a standing  committee  on administration and  finance,  whose  terms  of reference  shall  include,  among  other  things,  responsibility  for examining 
in detail  budget  estimates  proposed  to be submitted  by the Executive  Board  to the Health  Assembly,  and 
for reporting  thereon  to the  Executive  Board  " ; 
Considering  that  it would  be useful  to have  prepared  for the Eighth  World  Health  Assembly  a detailed 
analysis  of the financial  aspects  of the Director-General's  proposed  programme  and  budget  for 1956  ; 
Believing  that  such  an analysis  can  best  be made  by a small  group, 
INSTRUCTS  the Executive  Board  to establish  a Standing  Committee  on Administration  and  Finance,  to 
consist  of seven  of its members,  to make  a detailed  analysis  of the financial  aspects  of the proposed  programme  and  budget  for 1956  for the use of the Board.
