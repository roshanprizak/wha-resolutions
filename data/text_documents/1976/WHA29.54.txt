WHA29.54  Smallpox  eradication  programme 
The Twenty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  Director-General's  report  on the smallpox  eradication  programme  ； 
Noting  with  satisfaction  that  smallpox  is now  restricted  to only  a few  remote  villages  of a single  country 
and that  interruption  of smallpox  transmission  is believed  to be imminent; 
Bearing  in mind  the importance  of completing  the eradication  of smallpox  in the shortest  possible  period 
of time  and  of ensuring  confidence  in the achievement  by using  international  groups  of experts  to confirm 
the eradication  two  years  or more  after  the last  known  case; 
Recognizing  the  need  for  all laboratories  which  retain  stocks  of variola  virus  to take  maximum  precautions  to prevent  accidental  infection; 
Appreciating  the  importance  of continued  surveillance  and  research  to provide  further  assurance  that 
there  is no animal  or other  natural  reservoir  of the virus; 
Noting  that  the risk  of smallpox  importations  by persons  travelling  by sea or air has  so diminished  that 
no such  importations  have  occurred  during  the past  17 months; 
Noting  also  that,  as supplies  of vaccine  now  being  produced  are more  than  sufficient  in quantity  to meet 
all current  needs,  an accumulation  by WHO  of vaccine  stocks  for use in the event  of an unforeseen  emergency 
could  be established; 
1. CONGRATULATES  the many  countries  which  have  made  and  are making  such  A successful  and  determined 
effort  to eradicate  smallpox  ； 
2. EXTENDS  special  congratulations  to the 15 countries  of western  Africa  where  smallpox  eradication  was 
certified  on 15 April  1976  and  to Bangladesh,  India  and  Nepal,  which  interrupted  smallpox  transmission 
during  the  past  year; 
3. THANKS  all governments,  organizations  and  individuals  who  have  contributed  to the implementation  of 
the programme  and  requests  that  they  continue  to contribute  generously  to the  programme  until  global 
eradication  can  be certified  ； 
4. ENDORSES  the procedures  developed  by the Director-General  in the use of groups  of international  experts 
in the certification  of eradication  and  asks  for the full  cooperation  of all countries  concerned  in carrying  out 
these  procedures,  so that  countries  throughout  the  world  may  have  confidence  that  eradication  has  been 
achieved  ； 
5. URGES  that  all governments  continue  to conduct  surveillance  for  smallpox-like  illnesses  and  to inform 
the Organization  promptly  should  any  such  cases  be discovered; 
6. REQUESTS  all governments  and  laboratories  to cooperate  fully  in preparing  an international  registry  of 
laboratories  retaining  stocks  of variola  virus  but,  at the same  time,  urges  all laboratories  which  do not  require 
such  stocks  of variola  virus  to destroy  them  ； 
7. URGES  all governments  to restrict  their  requests  for  International  Certificates  of Smallpox  Vaccination 
to travellers  who,  within  the  preceding  14 days,  have  visited  a smallpox-infected  country  as reflected  in the 
WHO  Weekly  Epidemiological  Record； 
8. REQUESTS  Member  countries  to continue  to donate  vaccine  to the Voluntary  Fund  for  Health  Promotion 
so that  a reserve  supply  of 4 million  vials  of vaccine  (sufficient  to vaccinate  200  to 300  million  persons)  may 
be accumulated  which  could  be made  available  to Member  countries  in the event  of unforeseen  emergencies; 
9. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to obtain  expert  advice,  through  the  Committee  on International  Surveillance  of Communicable  Diseases  or by other  means,  on questions  such  as the  need  for  retention  of variola 
virus  in laboratories  and,  if necessary,  to make  recommendations  on the  number  and  distribution  of such 
laboratories  and  on the  precise  precautions  which  should  be taken  to prevent  accidental  infection; 
10. REQUESTS  further  the Director-General  to undertake  A study  of the organization  of A world  conference 
on the  problems  of eradicated  smallpox  and  to report  on the  subject  to the  Executive  Board  and  to the 
Thirtieth  World  Health  Assembly.
