The Sixty-seventh World Health Assembly, Having considered the report on hepatitis ;1 Reaffirming resolution WHA63.18, adopted in 2010 by the World Health Assembly, which recognized viral hepatitis as a global public health problem and the need for governments and populations to take action to prevent, diagnose and treat viral hepatitis, and that call ed upon WHO to develop and implement a comprehensive global strategy to support these efforts , and expressing concern at the slow pace of implementation; Recalling also resolution WHA45.17 on immunization and vaccine quality, which urged Member States include hepatitis B vaccines in national immunization programmes, and expressing concern that currently the global hepatitis B vaccine coverage for infants is estimated at 79% and is therefore below the 90% global target; Recalling further resolution WHA61. 21, which adopted the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property; Noting with deep concern that viral hepatitis is now responsible for 1.4 million deaths every year (compared to 1.6 million deaths from HIV / AID S, 1.3 million deaths from tuberculosis and 600 000 deaths from malaria), that around 500 million people are currently living with viral hepatitis and some 2000 million have been infected with hepatitis B virus, and considering that most people with chronic hepatitis Care unaware of their infection and are at serious risk of developing cirrhosis or liver cancer, contributing to global increases in both of those chronic diseases; Also noting that millions of acute infections with hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus occur annually and result in tens of thousands of deaths almost exclusively in lower- and middle-income countries; Considering that while hepatitis C is not preventable by vaccination, current treatment regimens offer high cure rates that are expected to further improve with upcoming new treatments; and that although hepatitis Bis preventable with a safe and effective vaccine, there are 240 million people living with hepatitis B virus infection and available effective therapies could prevent cirrhosis and liver cancer among many of those infected; 1 Document A67 / 13.

WHA6 7.6 3 absent in many countries that have a high burden of infection with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus; Cognizant of the fact that 4 5 million people living with HIV are coinfected with hepatitis C virus and more than 3 million are coinfected with hepatitis B virus, which has become a major cause of disability and mortality among those receiving antiretroviral therapy; Taking into account the fact that viral hepatitis is a major problem within indigenous communities in some countries; Welcoming the development by WHOof a global strategy, within a health systems approach, on the prevention and control of viral hepatitis i nfection;1 Considering that most Member States lack adequate surveillance systems for viral hepatitis to enable them to take evidence-based policy decisions; Taking into account that aperiodic evaluation of implementation of the WHO strategy is crucial to monitoring the global response to viral hepatitis and the fact that the process was initiated with the publication in 2013 of the Global policy report on the prevention and control of viral hepatitis in WHO Member States ;2 Acknowledging the need to reduce liver cancer mortality rates and that viral hepatitis is responsible for 78% of cases of primary liver cancer, and welcoming the inclusion of an indicator on hepatitis B vaccination in the comprehensive global monitoring framework adopted in resolution WHA66.10 on the Follow-up to the Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases; Acknowledging the need to fight and to eliminate stigmatization of, and discrimination agains t, people living with or affected by viral hepatitis and determined to protect and safeguard their human rights, 1.
