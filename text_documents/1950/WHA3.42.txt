WHA3.42  Supplies  for Governmental  Programmes 
In view  of the difficulties  experienced  by certain  governments  in obtaining  medical  supplies  for their 
programmes, 
The Third  World  Health  Assembly 
REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  to study  the question  of freer  and quicker  supplies  to governments  including the possibility  of setting  up a revolving  fund  to meet  this  purpose,  on the understanding  that  in every  case 
governments  would  be willing  to pay  in their  own  currencies. 
(Fifth  report  of the Committee  on Programme,  adopted 
at seventh  plenary  meeting,  25 May  1950)  [A3/R/59]
