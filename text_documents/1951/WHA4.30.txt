WHA4.30  Supply  of Insecticides 
The Fourth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  the present  critical  situation  of the world  supply  of chlorine-based  insecticides  employed in public  health  ; 
Having  taken  note  that  the  use  of insecticides  in public-health  programmes  is already  providing effective  protection  against  insect-borne  diseases  to very  large  populations  and,  as regards  malaria,  is safeguarding  the wellbeing  of at least  some  seventy  million  persons  ; 
Taking  into  account  the stimulation  of demand  for these  types  of insecticides  which  will  result  from the demonstrations  in this  field  of health  work  which  are being  made  possible  through  the United  Nations programme  of technical  assistance  for economic  development  ; 
Being  aware  that  the effectiveness  of this  weapon  in the struggle  to improve  world  health  requires  its continued  and  sustained  application, 
1. DIRECTS  the attention  of all governments  to the grave  repercussions  on world  health  of any interruption in activity  resulting  from  a diminution  in the quantities  of insecticides  available  for health  programmes  ; 
2. ENDORSES  the action  taken  by the Director-General  to present  to governments  of producing  countries the requirements  in insecticides  for world  health  purposes  and  to request  the assistance  of these  govern-ments  in maintaining  the necessary  volume  of export  shipments  to meet  those  requirements  ; 
3. CALLS  ON  all users  of insecticides  to exercise  the utmost  economy  consistent  with  technical  efficiency  ; 
4. URGES  governments  of countries  where  the means  of production  exist,  to take  vigorous  action  : 
(1) to make  available  to the producers  of chlorine-based  insecticides  in their  territories,  raw  materials and other  services  to an extent  sufficient  to enable  existing  production  capacity  to be fully  employed  ; 
(2) to make  arrangements  with  producers  for the granting  of priority  to requests  for such  insecticides for health  purposes  in other  countries  immediately  after  their  own  most  pressing  needs  have  been satisfied  ; 
(3) to facilitate  in every  way  the export  of these  insecticides  for health  programmes  ; 
5. REQUESTS  that,  in view  of the gravity  of the problem  and  its far-reaching  repercussions,  the United Nations,  through  its economic  commissions,  should  arrange  for the establishment  of a working  party  or parties  (or such  other  means  as the United  Nations  may  decide  upon)  representing  governments  concerned both  with  the production  and  the import  of chlorine-based  insecticides,  which  working  parties  would,  in consultation  with  the United  Nations  specialized  agencies  and  other  inter-governmental  organizations concerned,  investigate  this  international  problem  and  make  recommendations  to governments  and  inter-governmental  bodies  concerned  as to the methods  which  might  be applied  in order  to alleviate  the present situation  and  to ensure  that  the best  possible  use is made  of existing  availabilities  of these  precious  and scarce  commodities  ; 
6. INSTRUCTS  the Director-General  to continue  his present  efforts  to bring  about  an increase  in the world availability  of insecticides  for public-health  purposes  and  to co-operate  with  all other  inter-governmental agencies  concerned  with  the problem.
