Agenda  item  31.2  12  May  1993 
COLLABORATION  WITHIN  THE  UNITED  NATIONS  SYSTEM 
INTERNATIONAL  YEAR  OF THE  FAMILY  (1994) 
The Forty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the Director-General's  report  on "Collaboration  within  the United  Nations  system: 
International  Year  of the Family  (1994)"; 
Recalling  resolution  44/82  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly  proclaiming  1994  as the 
International  Year  of the Family  with the theme  "Family:  resources  and responsibilities  in a changing  world", 
and the conclusions  and recommendations  of Technical  Discussions  held at the time of Health  Assemblies  and 
of progress  reports  on such family-related  subjects  as the role of intersectoral  cooperation  in national  strategies 
for health  for all (resolution  WHA39.22);  the reproductive  health  of young  people  (resolution  WHA38.22)  and 
health  of youth  (resolution  WHA42.41);  mental  health  (resolution  WHA39.25);  women's  health  (resolution 
WHA42.42),  and substance  abuse  (resolution  WHA42.20); 
Noting  that the family  plays  a major  role in the caring,  nurturing,  and emotional  and material  support 
essential  to the growth  and well-being  of its members,  while  recognizing  that these  functions  of the family  may 
be undermined  or thwarted  by such circumstances  as war, drought,  famine,  racial  or ethnic  violence,  and 
economic  deprivation,  or in the case of inadequate  preparation  for parenthood  and family-building; 
Convinced  that equality  between  sexes,  women's  equal  participation  in employment,  and shared  parental 
responsibility  are key ingredients  for the attainment  of the goals  of health  for all; 
Reaffirming  the importance  of the role, responsibilities  and resources  of the family  in the health  of its 
individual  members  in particular,  and in primary  health  care in general, 
1. URGES  all Member  States: 
(1) to give effect  to the objectives  of the International  Year  of the Family  in the health  sector, 
including  the strengthening  of intersectoral  collaboration  in support  of the goals  of health  for all as a 
crucial  means  for meeting  the health  and other  development  needs  of families; 
(2) to determine,  in collaboration  with other  sectors,  which  families  are at risk of not being  able to 
meet the basic  needs  of their members,  and to develop  or strengthen  coordinated  support  to such 
families,  including  close  collaboration  with nongovernmental  organizations,  including  women's 
organizations; 
(3) to undertake  operational  research  on approaches  to enhancement  of the health,  nurturing,  caring 
and development  functions  within  the family;

(4) to ratify,  if they have not already  done  so, and to implement  such international  instruments  as the

the Rights  of the Child  as vehicles  for family  health  development; 
2. URGES  the Director-General: 
(1) to provide  coordinated  support  to Member  States,  with other  organizations  and bodies  of the 
United  Nations  system,  for research  on methods  for measuring  and evaluating  the impact  of policies  and 
programmes  on the health  and functioning  of the family  and its members,  and for determining  which 
fam√ºies  are at risk of not being  able to provide  for the basic  needs  of their members; 
(2) to examine  the cost and benefits  and social  implications  of a greater  involvement  of the family  in 
health  promotion,  disease  prevention,  treatment  and rehabilitation,  with particular  emphasis  on equity 
and on sharing  of family  responsibilities.
