behaviour；

nutritional  imbalances,  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  pregnancy  before biological  or 
social maturity,  the abuse of substances  including  tobacco,  alcohol and other drugs, and 
psychosocial  difficulties  and of the need for healthy development  among young people both 
in developed  and developing  countries； 
Concerned  at the high rate of unemployed  young people, in Member States, and of its 
consequences  far their health and integration  into society; 
Noting that although  the promotion  of young people's  health requires  action in many 
quarters,  the role of the health sector is central in the mobilization  of efforts to meet 
the health needs of adolescents  and youth and to encourage  the contribution  of young 
people to the goal of health for all； 
Recognizing  the critical  role of nongovernmental  organizations,  particularly  those 
for and of youth, and the innovative  approaches  that many of these organizations  have 
already generated;

of those groups of young people who are particularly  vulnerable,  disadvantaged,  or 
have special needs, such as those within minority  sub-cultures,  the disabled  or the 
marginalized;  such action should not be taken in isolation  but, to the extent 
possible,  as an integral  part of programmes  benefiting  other young people; 
(5) to train health workers and those from other sectors to appreciate  the 
developmental  basis of the health of youth, to be responsive  and sensitive  to the 
health needs and perspectives  of young people, and to have the necessary 
communication  skills for dealing with them;

(7) to draw the attention  of those working within the health sector, other sectors 
and among the general public, to the actions required  to meet the health needs of 
youth and to young people's  important  contributions  to health for all through 
different  fora, media and events such as national  conferences  and the designation  of 
national youth days； 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General:

(3) to take the necessary  steps to strengthen  WHO's programmes  dealing with 
adolescents  and youth at all levels, including  networks  of collaborating

area;
