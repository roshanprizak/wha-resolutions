WHA27.33  Coordination  within  the United  Nations  system  on programme  support  costs 
The Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the Director-General  on coordination  with  the  United  Nations,  the 
specialized  agencies  and  the International  Atomic  Energy  Agency,  with  respect  to administrative,  budgetary 
and financial  matters,  and  resolution  EB53.R47; 
Having  considered  the question  of programme  support  costs,  or overhead  costs,  of WHO  programme 
activities  financed  from  extrabudgetary  sources  ； 
Recalling  the opinions  expressed  on this  subject  at previous  sessions  of the Executive  Board  and  in the 
World  Health  Assembly,  as reflected  in resolutions  EB23.R79,  WHA12.31  and  WHA24.52, 
1. BELIEVES  that  the  full  cost  of the technical  and  administrative  services  and  support  necessary  for  the 
efficient  and  effective  implementation  by WHO  of programmes  financed  from  extrabudgetary  funds  should, 
in principle,  be financed  from  such  funds  ； 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to cooperate  in the Administrative  Committee  on Coordination  in the 
development  of a system  for the allocation  of programme  support  or overhead  costs  of programmes  financed 
from  extrabudgetary  funds,  which  could  be uniformly  applied  to all extrabudgetary-funded  activities  ；  and 
3. EXPRESSES  its willingness  to consider  any  future  long-term  proposals  which  the  Economic  and  Social 
Council  may  make  to the organizations  in the United  Nations  system  on the question  of the allocation  between 
regular  budget  funds  and  extrabudgetary  funds  of programme  support  or overhead  costs  of activities  financed 
from  extrabudgetary  funds.
