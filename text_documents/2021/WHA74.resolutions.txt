(Seventh plenary meeting, 31 May 2021 – Committee A, first report) WHA74.4 Reducing the burden of noncommunicable diseases through strengthening prevention and control of diabetes1 The Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly, Having considered the consolidated report by the Director-General;2  Recalling WHO’s global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2030 and the following five voluntary global diabetes-related targets for 2025: a 25% relative reduction in the overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases; halt the rise in diabetes and obesity; at least 50% of eligible people receive medicinal treatment (including glycaemic control) and counselling to prevent heart attacks and strokes; an 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major noncommunicable diseases (including diabetes) in both public and private facilities; and a 30% relative reduction in prevalence of current tobacco use in persons aged 15+ years; Recalling also the Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (United Nations General Assembly resolution 66/2 (2011), which recognizes the primary role and responsibility of Governments in responding to the challenge of noncommunicable diseases by developing adequate national multisectoral responses for their prevention and control; Also recalling resolution WHA66.10 (2013) on the endorsement of WHO’s global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020 and decision WHA72(11) (2019), which extended the global action plan until 2030; Reaffirming the right of every human being, without distinction of any kind, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; Recalling United Nations General Assembly resolution 70/1 (2015), which adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and defined the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the associated target 3.4 of reducing the risk of premature mortality from diabetes and other major noncommunicable diseases by one third by 2030; Having considered Annex 11 to the report of the Director-General in document A74/10 Rev.1 on major obstacles to achieving the diabetes-related targets in the WHO global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2030, including that halting the rising prevalence of diabetes, and reducing its impact, will not happen unless the five diabetes-related targets are achieved, including through reducing obesity; Reaffirming our commitment in United Nations General Assembly resolution 74/2 (2019) to progressively cover 1 billion additional people by 2023 with quality essential health services and quality,  1 See Annex 4 for the financial and administrative implications for the Secretariat of this resolution. 2 Document A74/10 Rev.1. 8 SEVENTY-FOURTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY     safe, effective, affordable and essential medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and health technologies, with a view to achieving universal health coverage by 2030; Noting that more than 420 million people are living with diabetes worldwide today, and that this number is estimated to rise to 578 million by 2030, and 700 million by 2045;1 Noting that the increasing number of people living with diabetes is strongly associated with insufficient prevention of risk factors that underly diabetes, such as overweight and obesity, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity and tobacco use, and related to socioeconomic status and the impact of the social, economic and environmental determinants of health; Highlighting also the commitment made to promote and implement policy, legislative and regulatory measures, including fiscal measures as appropriate, aiming at minimizing the impact of the main risk factors for diabetes, and to promote healthy diets and lifestyles; Concerned that the number of people living with diabetes is increasing when at the same time some types of diabetes can be largely prevented with healthy diets and physical activity; Aware that one in two adults living with diabetes type 2 are undiagnosed, and that four out of five adults living with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countries; Deeply concerned that, while the probability (risk) of premature death from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases decreased by 18% globally between 2000 and 2016, diabetes is showing, for the first time ever, a 5% increase in premature mortality during the same period;2 Noting with concern that, in high-income countries, the premature mortality rate due to diabetes increased in 2010–2016, following a decrease from 2000 to 2010, and that in low- and middle-income countries, the premature mortality rate due to diabetes increased across both periods;2 Concerned that people living with noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes, have a higher risk of becoming severely ill or dying from coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and are among those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic;3 Concerned also that complete or partial disruptions to diabetes prevention and control due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including in respect of early detection and diabetic complication management services, represent significant threats to the life and health of people living with diabetes; Noting that overweight and obesity with metabolic changes and hypertension can increase the risk of noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases; Reaffirming that universal health coverage implies that all people have access, without discrimination, to nationally determined sets of the needed promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative essential timely measures and health services, promotion of lifestyle changes, healthy and balanced diets and regular physical activity and essential, safe, affordable, effective and quality medicines and vaccines, while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the  1 See document A74/10 Rev.1. 2 World health statistics 2020: monitoring health for the SDGs, sustainable development goals.

Noting the disruptions to education and life-long learning as a result of the global pandemic and the increased demand for digital, competency-based education to provide all nurses and midwives with sufficient access to evidence, quality education and learning; Taking note of the Director-General’s report detailing the shortage and maldistribution of the nursing and midwifery workforces, and the prominent inequities that are projected to remain until 2030 unless decisive action is taken to improve education, increase economic demand for the creation of jobs in particular in rural areas, develop nursing and midwifery leadership, and protect and enable nurses and midwives in their service delivery environments; Recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on the poorest and the most vulnerable populations, with repercussions on health and development gains, in particular in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing states, thus hampering the achievement of universal health coverage and the strengthening of primary health care; Recognizing that primary health care is the corner-stone of a sustainable health system for universal health coverage, and that the health and care workforce is a fundamental pillar of primary health care; Further recognizing the crucial contribution of the nursing and midwifery professions to strengthening health systems, to increasing access to comprehensive and patient-centred health services for the people they serve across the lifespan, mindful of cultural contexts, and to the efforts to achieve the internationally agreed health-related development goals, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and those of WHO’s programmes; Recognizing the differences between nursing and midwifery and that while the two professions share many of the same challenges, they maintain their own specific scopes of practice; Acknowledging that the health, well-being, lives and safety of nurses and midwives, particularly for those providing front-line services, were already affected by health workforce and skills shortages in many countries, and that this is further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in increased stress, strain and burn-out and reduced productivity and performance, and impacting workforce retention and therefore the functioning, efficiency and resilience of health systems; Further acknowledging the importance shown by the COVID-19 pandemic of strengthening health worker protection and employees’ well-being, including through tailored approaches for psychosocial support, additional training and support for new practices for recovery and continuous monitoring of employee well-being, and ensuring respectful work environments that are free from racial and all other forms of discrimination; Concerned at the long-standing shortages and maldistribution of nurses and midwives in many countries, particularly in rural and remote settings, and the impact of this on health and development outcomes, which are inextricably linked, and recognizing the need for effective planning of the education, deployment and retention of health professionals – including through the collaboration of authorities responsible for health, education and employment – to educate, employ and retain an additional 5.7 million nurses and 750 000 midwives by the year 2030 in order to realize Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages);  RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 55     Recalling the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including Sustainable Development Goal 3, target 3.8 on achieving universal health coverage and target 3.c to “substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development, training and retention of the health workforce in developing countries, especially in least developed countries and small island developing States”; Noting also with concern that factors negatively affecting the recruitment and retention of general and specialized nursing and midwifery personnel persist and have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby hindering the capacity of countries, in particular developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States, to deliver efficient and effective quality health care and services; Reaffirming the continuing importance of resolution WHA63.16 (2010) in applying the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel and the WHO Global Code’s recognition that an adequate and accessible health workforce is fundamental to an integrated and effective health system, and to the provision of health services; Acknowledging that applying the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel is crucial to ensuring the proper and ethical management of international recruitment, and health personnel international migration, and that this can make a contribution to the development and strengthening of health systems, while bearing in mind the necessity of mitigating their impact in countries of origin; Reiterating the importance of continued and concerted efforts, and the provision of development assistance; and further recognizing with deep concern, the impact of high debt levels on countries’ ability to withstand the impact of the COVID-19 shock; Noting the specific needs and special circumstances of developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States, and those in fragile, conflict-affected and vulnerable settings, due to their vulnerabilities and capacity constraints, and their need for sustained technical and financial assistance aimed at strengthening health systems, including nursing and midwifery workforce development; Recognizing further the deliberations by Member States at the three High-Level Events on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond and the necessity to expand support for the most vulnerable, including through social and financial protection, and education and health systems, so that no one is left behind, as part of economic recovery at all levels; Acknowledging the importance of initiatives that promote gender equality, such as the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing +25), Generation Equality Forum and the Gender Equal Health and Care Workforce Initiative, bearing in mind that women account for 90% of the global nursing and midwifery workforce;

RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 65     forms of violence and eliminate common risk factors, as a prerequisite to long-term prevention of violence against women and violence against children; Further recognizing that over the course of their lifetime, children exposed to all forms of violence are at increased risk of delayed cognitive development, mental health conditions, high-risk and health-harming behaviours, and further interpersonal and self-directed violence, and that as a result of these they are more likely to be affected by noncommunicable diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, reproductive health problems and other negative social consequences including educational under-attainment; Noting that violence against children costs the world economy between US$ 1.49 trillion and US$ 6.9 trillion annually, that many of the economic costs fall to the health sector as it provides treatment for the acute and long-term consequences, and that this likely represents an underestimation of the full costs of violence against children since it does not consider the long-term impacts on future human capital formation of children exposed to violence;  Also noting with concern that the growing economic and financial burden aggravated by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will further exacerbate inequalities, increase poverty and hunger, and reverse the hard-won developmental gains, including in the health sector; Further noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered significant new needs and magnified pre-existing inequalities and vulnerabilities, leading to an increased risk of violence involving children and women, and increases in harmful practices and crimes resulting from, inter alia, closures of schools and protective services, increased isolation, emotional and economic burden on households, and mental health conditions, which threaten multiple aspects of children’s physical, psychological, sexual and reproductive health; Recognizing that state institutions can also be sites of violence, including violence in schools perpetrated by teachers and peers, noting that children face various forms of online violence as well as violence facilitated by information and communications technology (ICT), and that online and ICT-facilitated violence is disproportionately affecting women and girls; Concerned about the occurrence of bullying, both online and offline, in all parts of the world and the fact that children who are victimized by such practices may be at heightened risk of compromising their health, emotional well-being and academic work and a wide range of physical and/or mental health conditions, as well as about the potential long-term effects on the individual’s ability to realize her or his own potential; Also recognizing that violence against girls is based on discrimination, gender norms and gender inequalities and includes sexual and gender-based violence, child maltreatment, child, early and forced marriage, sexual harassment, female genital mutilation, partner violence, trafficking, and sexual exploitation and abuse, all of which requires specific attention by society, including health providers; Further recognizing that close interlinkages exist between the different forms of discrimination, violence and inequalities faced by children; Stressing that discrimination based on gender or age often overlaps with other forms of discrimination, as well as a range of social determinants, and that this may affect a child’s vulnerability to violence and often compounds the impacts of crisis and conflict on children; Recognizing also that children with disabilities are more likely than other children to experience physical, psychological, sexual and gender-based violence and neglect; 66 SEVENTY-FOURTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY     Recognizing further the special needs of and risks faced by migrant children, especially unaccompanied migrant children or children separated from their families, particularly with regard to all forms of violence, discrimination and exploitation, including sexual and gender-based violence, physical and psychological abuse, human trafficking and contemporary forms of slavery; Noting that victims of all forms of violence frequently suffer traumatic consequences that require care and treatment, and that psychosocial support needs to be provided to both victims and perpetrators to mitigate risks of violence in the future; Recognizing also that health systems are often not adequately addressing the problem of violence and the risk factors and determinants that cut across all forms of interpersonal violence, including violence against children, and not always contributing to a comprehensive, coordinated and multisectoral prevention and response to violence against children, and that strengthening health systems and achieving universal health coverage are essential to addressing both the risk factors for and determinants of violence against children and its consequences; Recognizing further that violence against children needs continuous, coordinated and multisectoral action for prevention, detection, response and monitoring; Concerned that violence against children is often exacerbated in humanitarian emergencies and in countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, and recognizing that health systems have an important role to play in preventing and responding to its consequences, underlining the need to protect health care facilities from attacks to ensure the delivery of health care services; Also recognizing that ensuring safe access and safeguarding the right to education, including in humanitarian emergencies and in countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, provides an environment that protects against violence and is an entry point for basic health and nutrition interventions; Acknowledging the need for greater international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels to address the issue of violence against children including in humanitarian emergencies and in countries in conflict and post-conflict situations; Stressing the importance of scaling up evidence-based preventive measures in line with obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures, to protect children from all forms of violence, including parent and caregiver support programmes and school- and community-based interventions, and public health and other measures to positively promote respectful child-rearing, free from violence, for all children, and to target the root cause of violence at the levels of the child, family, perpetrator, community, institution and society, and noting that these measures can be delivered by and with the health and other relevant sectors and civil society organizations, 1.
