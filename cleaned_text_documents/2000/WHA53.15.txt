The Fifty-third World Health Assembly,Deeply concerned that foodborne illnesses associated with microbial pathogens, biotoxins andchemical contaminants in food represent a serious threat to the health of millions of people in theworld;Recognizing that foodborne diseases significantly affect peoples health and well-being andhave economic consequences for individuals, families, communities, businesses, and countries;Acknowledging the importance of all services including public health services responsiblefor food safety, in ensuring the safety of food and in harmonizing the efforts of all stakeholdersthroughout the food chain;Aware of the increased concern of consumers about the safety of food, particularly after recentfoodborne-disease outbreaks of international and global scope and the emergence of new foodproducts derived from biotechnology;Recognizing the importance of the standards, guidelines and other recommendations of theCodex Alimentarius Commission for protecting the health of consumers and assuring fair tradingpractices;Noting the need for surveillance systems for assessment of the burden of foodborne disease andthe development of evidence-based national and international control strategies;Mindful that food safety systems must take account of the trend towards integration ofagriculture and the food industry and of ensuing changes in farming, production, and marketingpractices and consumer habits in both developed and developing countries;Mindful of the growing importance of microbiological agents in foodborne-disease outbreaks atinternational level and of the increasing resistance of some foodborne bacteria to common therapies,particularly because of the widespread use of antimicrobials in agriculture and in clinical practice;Aware of the improvements in public health protection and in the development of sustainablefood and agricultural sectors that could result from the enhancement of WHOs food safety activities;Recognizing that developing countries rely for their food supply primarily on traditionalagriculture and small- and medium-sized food industry, and that inmost developing countries, thefood safety systems remain weak,WHA53.1521. URGES Member States:(1) to integrate food safety as one of their essential public health and public nutritionfunctions and to provide adequate resources to establish and strengthen their food safetyprogrammes inclose collaboration with their applied nutrition and epidemiological surveillanceprogrammes;(2) to develop and implement systematic and sustainable preventive measures aimed atreducing significantly the occurrence of foodborne illnesses;(3) to develop and maintain national, and where appropriate, regional means for surveillanceof foodborne diseases and for monitoring and controlling relevant microorganisms andchemicals in food; to reinforce the principal responsibility of producers, manufacturers, andtraders for food safety; and to increase the capacity of laboratories, especially in developingcountries;(4) to integrate measures in their food safety policies aimed at preventing the development ofmicrobial agents that are resistant to antibiotics;(5) to support the development of science in the assessment of risks related to food, includingthe analysis of risk factors relevant to foodborne disease;(6) to integrate food safety matters into health and nutrition education and informationprogrammes for consumers, particularly within primary and secondary school curricula, and toinitiate culture-specific health and nutrition education programmes for food handlers,consumers, farmers, producers and agro-food industry personnel;(7) to develop outreach programmes for the private sector that can improve food safety at theconsumer level, with emphasis on hazard prevention and orientation for good manufacturingpractices, especially in urban food markets, taking into account the specific needs andcharacteristics of micro- and small-food industries, and to explore opportunities for cooperationwith the food industry and consumer associations in order to raise awareness regarding the useof good and ecologically safe farming and good hygienic and manufacturing practices;(8) to coordinate the food safety activities of all relevant national sectors concerned with foodsafety matters, particularly those related to the risk assessment of foodborne hazards, includingthe influence of packaging, storage and handling;(9) to participate actively in the work of the Codex Alimentarius Commission and itscommittees, including activities in the emerging area of food-safety risk analysis;(10) to ensure appropriate, full and accurate disclosure in labelling of food products, includingwarnings and best-before dates where relevant;(11) to legislate for control of the reuse of containers for food products and for the prohibitionof false claims;2. REQUESTS the Director-General:(1) to give greater emphasis to food safety, in view of WHO s global leadership in publichealth, and in collaboration and coordination with other international organizations, notably theWHA53.153Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and within the CodexAlimentarius Commission, and to work towards integrating food safety as one of WHO sessential public health functions, with the goal of developing sustainable, integrated food safetysystems for the reduction of health risk along the entire food chain, from the primary producerto the consumer;(2) to support Member States in the identification of food-related diseases and the assessmentof foodborne hazards, and storage, packaging and handling issues;(2 bis) to provide developing countries with support for the training of their staff, taking intoaccount the technological context of production in these countries;(3) to focus on emerging problems related to the development of antimicrobial-resistantmicroorganisms stemming from the use of antimicrobials in food production and clinicalpractice;(4) to put in place a global strategy for the surveillance of foodborne diseases and for theefficient gathering and exchange of information in and between countries and regions, takinginto account the current revision of the International Health Regulations;(5) to convene, as soon as practicable, an initial strategic planning meeting of food safetyexperts from Member States, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizationswith an interest in food safety issues;(6) to provide, inclose collaboration with other international organizations active in this area,particularly FAO and the International Office of Epizootics (OIE), technical support todeveloping countries in assessing the burden on health and prioritizing disease-control strategiesthrough the development of laboratory-based surveillance systems for major foodbornepathogens, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, and in monitoring contaminants in food;(7) in collaboration with FAO and other bodies as appropriate, to strengthen the applicationof science in the assessment of acute and long-term health risks related to food, and specificallyto support the establishment of an expert advisory body on microbiological risk assessment andto strengthen the expert advisory bodies that provide scientific guidance on food safety issuesrelated to chemicals, and to maintain an updated databank of this scientific evidence to supportMember States in making health-related decisions in these matters;(8) to ensure that the procedures for designating experts and preparing scientific opinions aresuch as to guarantee the transparency, excellence and independence of the opinions delivered;(9) to encourage research to support evidence-based strategies for the control of foodbornediseases, particularly research on risk factors related to emergence and increase of foodbornediseases and on simple methods for the management and control of health risks related to food;(10) to examine the current working relationship between WHO and FAO, with a view toincreasing the involvement and support of WHO in the work of the Codex AlimentariusCommission and its committees;(11) to support Member States in providing the scientific basis for health-related decisionsregarding genetically modified foods;WHA53.154(12) to support the inclusion of health considerations in international trade in food and fooddonations;(13) to make the largest possible use of information from developing countries in riskassessment for international standard-setting, and to strengthen technical training in developingcountries by providing them with a comprehensive document in WHO working languages, tothe extent possible;(14) to proactively pursue action, on behalf of developing countries, so that the level oftechnological development in developing countries is taken into account in the adoption andapplication of international standards on food safety;(15) to respond immediately to international and national food safety emergencies and to assistcountries in crisis management;(16) to call upon all stakeholders especially the private sector to take their responsibilityfor the quality and safety of food production, including environmental protection awarenessthroughout the food chain;(17) to support capacity building in Member States, especially those from the developingworld, and facilitate their full participation in the work of the Codex Alimentarius Commissionand its different committees, including activities in food safety risk analysis processes.Eighth plenary meeting, 20 May 2000A53 / VR / 8= = =
