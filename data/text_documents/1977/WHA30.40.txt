The Thirtieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  Director-General's  report  on the  development  and  coordination  of biomedical 
and health  services  research, 
1. THANKS  the Director-General  for his report;

3. ENDORSES  the research  policy  guidelines  outlined  by the Director-General,  with  particular  attention  to: 
(1) the  role  of WHO  in strengthening  national  research  capabilities,  promoting  international  cooperation, 
and ensuring  the appropriate  transfer  of existing  and  new  scientific  knowledge  to those  who  need  it; 
(2) the  emphasis  on greater  regional  involvement  in research,  with  the active  participation  of regional 
advisory  committees  on medical  research  ； 
(3) the  setting  of research  goals  and  priorities  in the  regions  in response  to the  expressed  needs  of 
Member  States; 
(4) the  concept  of special  programmes  for research  and  training  in major  mission-oriented  programmes 
of the Organization; 
(5) the  keeping  of an appropriate  balance  between  biomedical  and  health  services  research; 
4. REAFFIRMS  that  effective  biomedical  and  health  services  research  activities  aimed  at the solution  of major

(1) close  coordination  between  the regional  and  the global  advisory  committees  on medical  research  in 
(2) collaboration  with  medical  research  councils  or analogous  national  research  bodies  to ensure 
effective  coordination  of national,  regional  and  global  research  programmes; 
(3) utilization  of research  promotion  mechanisms,  such  as scientific  working  groups,  to ensure  broadly 
based  participation  of the scientific  community  in the planning,  implementation  and  evaluation  of WHO,s 
research  programmes; 
(4) increased  technical  cooperation  with,  and  between,  research  institutions  of Member  countries  to 
carry  out  collaborative  research  and  training  and  improve  communication  between  scientists; 
(5) developing  and  strengthening  of research  into  the  more  efficient  deployment  of resources  within 
health  care  delivery  systems,  especially  on a national  and  regional  basis; 
(6) broadening  the basis  of advice  and  support  for health  services  research  by extending  the membership of the Advisory  Committee  on Medical  Research  and  related  committees  and  the  WHO  collaborating  centres  to include  representatives  of social,  management  and  other  sciences  ； 
(7) increasing  the number  of collaborating  centres  in the field  of health  services  research,  and  ensuring 
the strengthening  of this  research  ； 
(8) achieving  a balanced  geographical  distribution  of collaborating  centres  for biomedical  and  health 
services  research; 
6. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to further  elaborate  the  WHO  long-term  programme  in the  field  of 
development  and  coordination  of biomedical  and  health  services  research,  taking  into  account  the suggestions 
of the Advisory  Committee  on Medical  Research,  of regional  committees  and  regional  advisory  committees 
on medical  research,  as well  as the  forecasts  of developments  in medical  science  and  health  practice  in 
Member  States；  and  to report  his further  proposals  to the  Executive  Board  and  to the  Health  Assembly.
