Extended borrowing authority
The Thirty-second World Health Assembly,
Having considered the report^ of the Director-General on any further developments 
affecting the supplementary budgetary requirements for 1979, and the recommendations, on 
behalf of the Board, of the Committee of the Executive Board to Consider Certain Financial 
Matters Prior to the Thirty-second World Health Assembly,
1. STRESSES the need to ensure the financing of the approved programme budget for 1979 and 
to this end urges all Member States which have not already done so to pay their assessed 
contributions as early as possible;
2. AUTHORIZES the Director-General, if the cash balance of the Working Capital Fund, and 
such internal borrowing as may be possible and practical under Financial Regulation 5.1, 
should prove to be temporarily inadequate to finance the approved programme budget for 1979 ，  
to borrow funds from governments, banks or other external sources;
3. DECIDES that repayment of such loans be made as soon as contributions received make this 
possible, and will have priority over the repayment of funds borrowed internally pursuant to 
Financial Regulations 5.1 and 6.3;
4. DECIDES further that any interest due on such loans be charged to the Casual Income 
Account;
5. REQUESTS the Director-General to report any such borrowings to the Executive Board at its 
next session.
