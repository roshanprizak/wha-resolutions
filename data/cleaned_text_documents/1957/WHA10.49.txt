Tenth World Health Assembly, Considering (1) that since 1949 the Pan American Sanitary Organization has adopted essentially the staff regulations relating to salaries, allowances and benefits of the World Health Organization, in order to assure uniformity of conditions of employment for the combined staffs of WHO / PASB; (2) that full realization of efforts to establish uniform and equitable conditions of appointment for the staff of WHO / PASB has not been achieved; (3) that the present complicated system of multiple allowances presents a very difficult administrative problem; (4) that, although the complicated group of allowances may, in certain cases, provide adequate remuneration, these allowances fail to attract to the Organization the young public-health officer who should become the career officer of the Organization in the future; (5) that the base remuneration for positions requiring a high degree of educational training and proficiency renders more difficult the recruitment of medical public-health workers; and (6) that the Directing Council of PASO (which serves as Regional Committee of WHO for the Americas) at its session in 1956 adopted a resolution which provides, inter alia, that " in the event the United Nations fails to authorize a single system of salaries, allowances, and benefits for all staff in all programmes, and the WHO Executive Board does not authorize such a system of employment, to take such steps as are necessary to effect a single set of conditions of employment for both regular and project staff ", 1. RESOLVES that the question of salaries, allowances and benefits for the staff of the Region of the Americas be referred to the Executive Board, with authority to make recommendations to the World Health Assembly with respect to the means of correcting the outstanding difficulties cited; and 2. REQUESTS that the Executive Board consult with the Directing Council of the Pan American Sanitary Organization regarding suitable staff regulations on salaries and allowances adapted to the needs of international health organizations.
