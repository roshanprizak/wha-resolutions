RÉSOLUTION D E  L 'A S
Reaffirming the statement in the Declaration of Alma-Ata to the effect that an acceptable 
level of health for all the peoples of the world by the year 2000 can be attained through 
fuller and better use of the world's resources, a considerable part of which is now spent on 
armaments and military conflicts, and that a genuine policy of independence, peace, détente 
and disarmament could and should release additional resources that could well be devoted to 
peaceful aims and in particular to the acceleration of social and economic development, of 
which primary health care is an essential part;
Noting resolutions ЪЪ/ll  А, ЗЗ/91 E, 33/71 H and ЗЗ/66 Б and other resolutions adopted in

new types of weapons of mass destruction, banning of aggressive military conflicts, and

the world;
