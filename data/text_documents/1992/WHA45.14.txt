ASSESSMENT  OF NEW  MEMBERS  AND  ASSOCIATE  MEMBERS 
ASSESSMENT  OF SLOVENIA 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  that Slovenia  became  a Member  of the World  Health  Organization  on 7 May 1992，subject  to its 
depositing  a formal  instrument  of acceptance  of the WHO  Constitution  with the Secretary-General  of the 
United  Nations; 
Noting  that Slovenia  is not yet a Member  of the United  Nations  and thus the United  Nations  General 
Assembly  has not yet established  an assessment  rate for Slovenia; 
Noting  that the contribution  payable  by Slovenia  in 1992  would  in effect  constitute  budgetary  income  to 
the extent  that it would  be deducted  from  the contribution  payable  by Yugoslavia; 
Recalling  the principle  established  in resolution  WHA8.5,  and confirmed  in resolution  WHA24.12,  that 
the latest  available  United  Nations  scale  of assessments  should  be used as a basis  for determining  the scale  of 
assessments  to be used  by WHO; 
Recalling  further  that the Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly,  in resolution  WHA26.21,  affirmed  its 
belief  that the scale  of assessments  in WHO  should  follow  as closely  as possible  that of the United  Nations, 
DECIDES: 
(1) that  should  Slovenia  become  a Member  of the United  Nations  in 1992,  its assessment  rate for 1992 
in WHO  shall  be calculated  by the Director-General  on the basis  of the United  Nations  assessment  rate; 
(2) that  should  Slovenia  not become  a Member  of the United  Nations  in 1992，the  Director-General 
should  put forward  a proposal  to the Forty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly  to establish  a provisional  rate of 
assessment  for 1992  together  with any consequential  amendments  to the assessment  of Yugoslavia  for 
1992; ^ 
(3) that  Slovenia's  assessment  relating  to the year 1992  shall be reduced  to one-third  of the WHO 
assessment  rate calculated  in accordance  with operative  paragraph  (1) above  or operative  paragraph  (2) 
above,  as the case may be; 
(4) that  Slovenia's  reduced  assessment  rate and contributions  payable  for 1992  shall be deducted  from 
those  applicable  to Yugoslavia,  without  prejudice  to any decision  on this matter  which  may be taken  by 
the United  Nations  General  Assembly  at a later  date; 世界銜生大會决議  丨；^  jW
