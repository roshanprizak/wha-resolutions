WHA4.23  Co-ordination  of Technical  Assistance  Programmes 
The Fourth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  that  assistance  in the field  of health  is furnished  in many  countries  by more  than  one  agency 
and in some  cases  by several  agencies  ; 
Recognizing  that  the highest  degree  of co-ordination  of the various  assistance  programmes  is desirable  ; 
Recognizing  that  such  co-ordination  must  be achieved  both  by consultation  between  the  different 
agencies  at the planning  stage  and  particularly  by co-ordination  of both  plans  and  operations  in the 
host countries  ; 
Recognizing  that  a major  function  of the  World  Health  Organization  is to act as co-ordinating 
authority  on international  health  work  ; 
Recognizing  that  in some  host  countries  a high  degree  of co-ordination  in the field  of international 
health  programmes  has  been  achieved  through  the setting-up  of national  co-ordinating  committees  under 
the minister  or director-general  of health, 
1. URGES  upon  Members  the  desirability  of promoting  such  co-ordination  : 
(1) by  encouraging  agencies  furnishing  technical  assistance  to co-operate  with  the  World  Health 
Organization  when  planning  their  activities, 
(2) by  establishing  within  their  own  governments  single  points  of contact  for  outside  agencies 
furnishing  assistance  in health  matters, 
(3) by  establishing  appropriate  arrangements  for consultation  between  their  own  governments  and 
such  outside  agencies  with  respect  to such  assistance  ; 
2. EMPHASIZES 
(1) that,  if no overall  co-ordinating  arrangements  already  exist,  a national  co-ordinating  committee 
in the field  of health  may  be desirable  and  this  or some  similar  arrangement  should  be actively 
considered  and  promoted,  and 
(2) that,  if overall  co-ordinating  arrangements  do exist,  any special  arrangements  in the field  of health 
should  be brought  within  the  framework  of such  overall  arrangements  ; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to use  appropriate  means  and  occasions  to bring  to the attention  of 
Members  these  and  other  suitable  methods  of co-ordinating  technical  assistance  programmes.

adopted  at the eleventh  plenary  meeting,  25 May  1951  )
