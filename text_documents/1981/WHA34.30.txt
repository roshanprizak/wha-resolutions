COLLABORATION  WITH THE UNITED NATIONS  SYSTEM - INTERNATIONAL  YEAR OF 
DISABLED  PERSONS,  1981: WHO'S COOPERATIVE  ACTIVITIES  WITHIN THE UNITED 
NATIONS SYSTEM FOR DISABILITY  PREVENTION  AND REHABILITATION 
The Thirty-fourth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  31/123 of the United Nations  General  Assembly  proclaiming 
the year 1981 as "International  Year of the Disabled  Persons"; 
Recalling  resolution  WHA31.39  requesting  the Director-General  to contribute 
extensively  to the success  of the International  Year; 
Considering  that the disabled,  rather than being a load on the society  and 
nations,  should benefit  from the effort of prevention,  treatment,  readaptation 
and rehabilitation  to enable them to effectively  share in the normal activities  of 
society; 
Noting that in addition  to malnutrition,  communicable  diseases,  poor quality 
of care, and traffic  and work accidents,  wars, armed aggressions,  torture  and 
the suppression  of fundamental  human rights constitute  a factor in the considerably 
increasing  number of physically,  psycho-traumatically  and mentally  disabled  persons； 
Noting the efforts  deployed  by the Director-General  in favour of the disabled; 
1. CONGRATULATES  the Director-General  for his report1  and on the action already 
taken; 
2. RECOîltlENDS  that the Member States: 
(1) continue  and increase  their efforts  to ensure the success  of the 
International  Year of the Disabled  Persons; 
(2) build on these efforts  and develop  permanent  programmes  that would benefit 
the disabled,  as an integral  part of activities  towards  the goal of Health For 
All by the year 2000; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to collaborate  with Member States in support  of programmes  of disability 
prevention  and rehabilitation  within the primary  health care context, 
especially  in developing  countries; 
(2) to enhance  cooperation  with other United Nations  agencies,  regional 
intergovernmental  organizations  and international  nongovernmental  organizations 
in the planning  and implementation  of the above programmes；
