Referring  to resolution  ARf/rC3o/r14  of the Regional  Committee  for Africa adopted  in

structures  in the light of its functions；

Noting the escalation  of aggression  perpetrated  by the racist minority  regime of South 
Africa against  the People's  Republic  of Angola,  the People's  Republic  of Mozambique  and the 
Republic  of Zambia;

destruction  of the health infrastructure  in front-line  states,  coupled  with economic  blackmail 
of the above states,  including  Lesotho  and Swaziland;

Reaffirming  the right of the people of Namibia  and South Africa to determine  their own 
health policies  and to participate  in the global strategy  of health for all by the year 2000;

to an increase  in the number of refugees  in the front-line  states,  Lesotho  and Swaziland；

Republic  of Zimbabwe,  the health situation  in this newly independent  country  still remains
