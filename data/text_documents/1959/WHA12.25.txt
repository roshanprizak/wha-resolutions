The Twelfth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  resolution  EB23.R83  of the  Executive  Board  and  the  report  of the  DirectorGeneral  on the method  of financing  pilot  projects  of an experimental  scientific  research  nature  ; 
Considering  that  resolution  WHA2.19  gives  the guiding  principles  which  should  be applied  in the 
organization  of research  under  the  auspices  of the World  Health  Organization  and  states  among  other 
things:  " research  should  be supported  in existing  institutions  and  should  form  part  of the duties  of field 
teams  supported  by the  World  Health  Organization  " ; 
Considering  that  new  knowledge  in medical  and  public  health  fields  often  needs  to be tried,  tested 
and suitably  applied  to local  conditions  in pilot  projects;  and 
Considering  that  pilot  projects  are of considerable  importance  and  of great  potential  benefit  both 
from  the  national  and  international  points  of view, 
BELIEVES  that  no change  is called  for in the method  of financing  pilot  projects  of an experimental 
scientific  research  nature.
