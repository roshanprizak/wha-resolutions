WHA4.81  Sanitary  Protection  in the case  of Mass  Movements  of Populations 
Considering  the health  risks  involved  in certain  movements  of populations,  such  as the movements  of refugees,  pilgrims,  etc.,  both  for the populations  themselves  and  for those  of the countries  to which  they  go and through  which  they  pass, 
The Fourth  World  Health  Assembly 
INVITES  the Executive  Board  to request  the competent  expert  committee  : 
(1) to study  the regulations  which  it might  be advisable  to add  to the International  Sanitary  Regula-tions  (WHO  Regulations  No.  2) : 
(a) for  the sanitary  protection  of populations  in mass  movement  under  unfavourable  sanitary 
conditions,  and 
(b) to prevent  the international  diffusion  of the quarantinable  diseases  which  such  movements may cause  ; 
(2) to take  fully  into  account  the epidemiological  and  sanitary  conditions  prevailing  in the various regions  in order  to adapt  the additional  regulations  to these  conditions. 
(Presented  by the Committee  on International  Sanitary Regulations  and  adopted  at the  eleventh  plenary meeting,  25 May  1951)  [A4/R/67]
