rehabilitation; 
Recalling the Convention on the Rights of Persons  with Disabilities, signed by 155 countries 
and regional integration organizati ons and now ratified by 127, which highlights that disability is both 
a human rights issue and a development issue and,  for States Parties, recommends that national 
policies and international development programmes are inclusive of and accessible to persons with 
disabilities; 
Recalling United Nations General Assembly r esolutions calling for the mainstreaming of 
disability in the development agenda (64/131 on realizing the Millennium Development Goals for 
persons with disabilities, 65/186 on realizing the Millennium Development Goals for persons with 
disabilities towards 2015 and beyond, and 66/229 on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with

Recognizing existing national and regional efforts to facilitate the enjoyment of all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disab ilities, and to promote respect for their inherent 
dignity; 
Welcoming the first World report on disability ,2 which is based on the best available scientific 
evidence and which shows that many of the barri ers people with disabilities face are avoidable and 
that the disadvantage associated with disability can be overcome; 
Noting that an estimated 1000 million people live w ith disabilities; that this number is set to 
increase as populations age, as the prevalence of ch ronic health conditions rises, and in response to 
trends in environmental and other factors; th at disability disproportionately affects vulnerable 
populations, notably women, older people and poor pe ople; that low-income countries have a higher 
prevalence of disability than high-income countries;  and that people with disabilities, particularly

2 those in developing countries, e xperience poorer health than people without disabilities, higher rates of 
poverty, lower rates of educational participation and employment, increased dependency and restricted 
participation, and higher rates of violence and abuse than non-disabled people; 
Further recalling that, according to the Conven tion on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
persons with disabilities include those who have lo ng-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory 
impairments which in interaction w ith various barriers may hinder thei r full and effective participation 
in society on an equal basis with others; 
Recognizing the responsibility of Member States to  take appropriate measures to ensure equal 
access to health services and care for persons w ith disabilities ideally through universal health 
coverage; 
Recognizing that people with disabilities have the same need for general health care as 
non-disabled people, yet have been shown to receive poorer treatment from health care systems than 
non-disabled people; 
Recognizing the important role that formal and informal caregivers play in supporting persons 
with disabilities and that, although informal caregivers cannot replace the role of the national and local 
authorities, they do need particular attention from th e authorities to help them with their tasks, and 
noting that both formal and informal caregivers’ role  is increasing in the context of the sustainability 
of health systems and the ageing of the population; 
Acknowledging that providing universal access to health care and health services is an 
investment for society; 
Also recognizing the extensive unmet needs fo r habilitation and rehabilitation services, which 
are vital to enable many people with a broad range of disabilities to participate in education, the labour 
market, and civic life, and, further, that measures to promote the health of people with disabilities and 
their inclusion in society through general and speci alized health services are as important as measures 
to prevent people developing health conditions associated with disability; 
Acknowledging that a comprehensive multisectoral a pproach is required to meet the multiple 
barriers faced by persons with disabilities and that  mainstreaming disability in development is the 
most efficient and cost-effective way of m eeting the needs of people with disabilities; 
Welcoming the work of WHO’s Task Force on Disability to raise awareness of disability as a 
cross-cutting issue in WHO’s technical work, a nd in removing physical, information and policy
