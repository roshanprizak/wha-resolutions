WHA30.47  Evaluation  of the effects  of chemicals  on health 
The Thirtieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA26.58,  WHA27.49,  WHA28.63,  WHA29.45  and  WHA29.57; 
Considering  that  the growing  use  of chemicals  in public  health,  industry,  agriculture,  food  production 
and in the  home,  together  with  environmental  pollution  resulting  from  rapid  industrialization  and  new 
technologies,  will  need  recognition  in the health  policies  and  strategies  of all countries,  as has already  been 
the case  in several  Member  States  that  have  introduced  new  legislation  in this  field; 
Concerned  at the acute  and  especially  the chronic  or combined  toxic  effects,  not only  on present  but  on 
future  generations,  that  may  result  from  exposure  to chemicals  in air,  water,  food,  consumer  products  and 
at the place  of work,  particularly  if combined  with  exposure  to other  chemicals,  infectious  agents  and  physical 
factors; 
Disturbed  by the increasing  number  of accidental  releases  of chemicals  into  the environment,  resulting 
in adverse  effects  on health  of epidemic  proportions  ； 
Aware  of the progress  made  by WHO  and  its International  Agency  for Research  on Cancer,  with  the 
active  cooperation  of Member  States,  in evaluating  health  hazards  from  exposure  to chemicals;  and  bearing 
in mind  the activities  being  carried  out  by other  organizations,  in particular  the United  Nations  Environment 
Programme's  International  Register  of Potentially  Toxic  Chemicals; 
Recognizing,  however,  that  so far existing  national  or international  programmes  have  not  been  able  to 
deal adequately  with  the long-term  aspects  of human  exposure  to chemicals  ； 
REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to study  the problem  and  long-term  strategies  in this  field;  and,  in collaboration  with  appropriate 
national  institutions  and  international  organizations,  to examine  the possible  options  for international 
cooperation,  including  the financial  and  organizational  implications,  with  a view  to : 
(a) accelerating  and  making  more  effective  the evaluation  of health  risks  from  exposure  to chemicals,  and  promoting  the use  of experimental  and  epidemiological  methods  that  will  produce  internationally  comparable  results; 
(b) exchanging  information  on new  chemical  hazards  to public  health; 
(c) providing  rapid  and  effective  response  in emergencies  and  in developing  arrangements  for 
mutual  assistance  between  Member  States  ； 
(d) developing  manpower  in this  field; 
(2) to report  the results  of this  study,  together  with  his recommendations,  to the Executive  Board  and 
the Health  Assembly  as soon  as possible.
