The Twenty-fourth World Health Assembly, Having considered the Director-General's report on the smallpox eradication programme; Having noted that significant progress is being made in the eradication effort throughout the world to the extent that endemic smallpox is now present in fewer than ten countries; Believing that a renewed and intensified effort is now required in order to reach the objective of global eradication in the shortest possible period of time; and Noting that improved reporting aswell as surveillance and containment measures have been of vital importance in the interruption of smallpox transmission, 1. REQUESTS all countries to give priority attention to the further improvement of case reporting and the immediate investigation and effective containment of all outbreaks of smallpox; 2. URGES governments of Member States to provide the requisite additional assistance to those countries where the disease is still endemic to permit them to intensify current programmes; and 3. REQUESTS the Director-General to report to the Twenty-fifth World Health Assembly on the development of the smallpox eradication programme. Handb. Res., 11th ed., 1.5.6 Seventeenth plenary meeting, 20 May 1971 (Committee A, fifth report)
