Agenda item  15.7 24 May 20 14 
Health intervention and technology assessment  
in support of universal health coverage   
 
The Sixty -seventh World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on health intervention and technology assessment in support of 
universal health coverage;1 
Recalling resolutions WHA52.19 on the revised drug strategy, WHA58.33 on sustainable health 
financing, universal coverage and social health insurance, WHA60.16 on progress in the rational use 
of medicines, WHA60.29 on health technologies, WHA63.21 on WHO’s role and responsibilities in 
health research, and WHA64.9 on sustainable health financing structures and univers al coverage; 
Recognizing the importance of evidence -based policy development and decision -making in 
health systems, including decisions on resource allocation, service system designs and translation of 
policies into practice, as well as reaffirming WHO’s r oles and responsibilities in provision of support 
to strengthen information systems and health research capacity, and their utilization in Member States; 
Noting that the efficient use of resources is a crucial factor in the sustainability of health 
systems ’ performance, especially when significant increases in access to essential medicines, including 
generic medicines, to medical devices and procedures, and to other health care interventions for 
promotion, prevention, diagnosis and treatment, rehabilitation  and palliative care are pursued by 
Member States, as they move towards universal health coverage;  
Noting that The world health report 20102 indicates that as much as 40% of spending on health 
is being wasted and that there is, therefore, an urgent need for systematic, effective solutions to reduce 
such inefficiencies and to enhance the rational use of health technology;  
Acknowledging the crit ical role of independent health intervention and technology assessment, 
as multidisciplinary policy research, in generating evidence to inform prioritization, selection, 
introduction, distribution, and management of interventions for health promotion, dise ase prevention, 
diagnosis and treatment, and rehabilitation and palliation;  
Emphasizing that with rigorous and structured research methodology and transparent and 
inclusive processes, assessment of medicines, vaccines, medical devices and equipment, and he alth

2 procedures, including preventive intervention,  could help to address the demand for reliable 
information on the safety, efficacy, quality, appropriateness, cost –effectiveness  and efficiency 
dimensions of such technologies to determine if and when they  are integrated into particular health 
interventions and systems;  
Concerned that the capacity to assess, research and document the public health, economic, 
organizational, social, legal and ethical implications of health interventions and technologies is 
inadequate in most developing countries, resulting in inadequate information to guide rational policy, 
and professional decisions and practices;  
Recognizing the importance of strengthened national capacity, regional and international 
networking, and collabo ration on health intervention and technology assessment to promote evidence based health policy,  
1. URGES Member States:1 
(1) to consider establishing national systems of health intervention and technology 
assessment , encourag ing the systematic utilization  of independent health intervention and 
technology assessment in support of universal health coverage to inform policy decisions, 
including priority -setting, selection, procurement supply system management and use of health 
interventions and/or technologie s, as well as the formulation of sustainable financing benefit 
packages, medicines, benefits management including pharmaceutical formularies, clinical 
practice guidelines and protocols for public health programmes;  
(2) to strengthen the link between health  technology assessment and regulation and 
management, as appropriate;  
(3) to consider, in addition to the use of established and widely agreed methods, developing , 
as appropriate , national methodological and process guidelines and monitoring systems for 
health intervention and technology assessment in order to ensure the transparency, quality and 
policy relevance of related assessments and research;  
(4) to further consolidate and promote health intervention and technology assessment within 
national framewor ks, such as those for health system research, health professional education, 
health system strengthening and universal health coverage;  
(5) to consider strengthening national capacity for regional and international networking, 
developing national know -how, avoiding duplication of efforts and achieving better use of resources;  
(6) to consider also collaborating with other Member States’ health organizations, academic 
institutions, professional associations and other key stakeholders in the country or region in 
order to collect and share information and lessons learnt so as to formulate and implement 
national strategic plans concerning capacity -building for and introduction of health intervention 
and technology assessment, and summarizing best practices in tra nsparent, evidence -informed 
health policy and decision -making;  
(7) to identify gaps with regard to promoting and implementing evidence -based health 
policy, as well as improving related information systems and research capacity, and  considering

  3 seeking technical support and exchanging information and sharing experiences with other 
Member States, regional networks and international entities, including WHO;  
(8) to develop and improve the collection of data on health intervention and technology 
assessment, training relevant professionals, as appropriate, so as to improve assessment capacity;  
2. REQUESTS the Director -General:  
(1) to assess the status of health intervention and technology assessment in Member States in 
terms of methodology, human resources and  institutional capacity, governance, linkage between 
health intervention and technology assessment units and/or networks with policy authorities, 
utilization of assessment results, and interest in and impediments to strengthening capacity;  
(2) to raise awa reness , foster knowledge and encourage the practice of health intervention 
and technology assessment and its uses in evidence -based decision -making among national 
policy -makers and other stakeholders, by drawing best practices from the operation, 
performan ce and contribution of competent research institutes and health intervention and 
technology assessment agencies and programmes, and sharing such experiences with Member 
States through appropriate channels and activities, including global and regional netwo rks and 
academic institutions;  
(3) to integrate health intervention and technology assessment concepts and principles into 
the relevant strategies and areas of work of WHO, including, but not limited to, those on 
universal health coverage, including health  financing, access to and rational use of quality assured medicines, vaccines and other health technologies, the prevention and management of 
noncommunicable and communicable diseases, mother and child care, and the formulation of 
evidence -based health pol icy; 
(4) to provide technical support to Member States, especially low -income countries, relevant 
intergovernmental organizations and global health partners, in order to strengthen capacity for 
health intervention and technology assessment, including, when  appropriate, the development 
and use of global guidance on methods and processes based on internationally agreed practices;  
(5) to ensure adequate capacity at all levels of WHO, utilizing its networks of experts and 
collaborating centres, as well as other  regional and international networks, in order to address 
the demand for support to facilitate evidence -based policy decisions in Member States;  
(6) to support the exchange of information, sharing of experiences and capacity -building in 
health intervention  and technology assessment through collaborative mechanisms and networks 
at global, regional and country levels, as well as ensuring that these partnerships are active, 
effective and sustainable;  
(7) to report on progress in the implementation of this reso lution  to the Sixty -ninth World
