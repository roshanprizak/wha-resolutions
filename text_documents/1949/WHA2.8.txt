WHA2.8.  Publications  : International  Digest  of Health  Legislation 
Whereas  the  publication  of the  International  Digest  of Health  Legislation  involves 
difficult  problems  of selection  of material  and  of the  relative  prominence  to be given 
to it, 
The Second  World  Health  Assembly 
RESOLVES  that  the  Director-General  be requested  to submit  to the  Third  World 
Health  Assembly  a report  on the methods  considered  to be most  satisfactory  of making 
available  information  on health  legislation  and  of presentation  and  publication  of such 
health  legislation  as is considered  to be of international  importance.
