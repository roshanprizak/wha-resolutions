WHA22.39  Re-examination  of the Global  Strategy  of Malaria  Eradication 
The Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the Director-General  on the  re-examination  of the  global  strategy  of 
malaria  eradication  ；2 
Noting  with  satisfaction  the steps  taken  by the Director-General  in pursuance  of resolution  WHA21.22 
and the successes  achieved  by the malaria  eradication  campaign  in a certain  number  of countries; 
Recognizing  the  part  played  by socio-economic,  financial,  administrative  and  operational  factors,  as 
also by the inadequacy  of the  basic  health  services,  in the failures  recorded  during  the implementation  of the 
global  malaria  eradication  programme; 
Reaffirming  that  complete  eradication  of malaria  from  the  world  remains  a primary  task  of national 
public  health  organizations,  and  that  even  in the  regions  where  eradication  does  not  yet  seem  feasible, 
control  of malaria  with  the means  available  should  be encouraged  and  may  be regarded  as a necessary  and 
valid  step  towards  the  ultimate  goal  of eradication  ； 
Bearing  in mind  that  it is imperative  to adapt  the  strategy  to local  epidemiological  situations  as well 
as to the available  administrative  and  economic  resources  of the countries  concerned,  and  that  the observance 
of this  condition  is equally  essential  both  for the achievement  of eradication  and  for its maintenance; 
Recognizing,  moreoyer,  that,  in order  to confront  the financial  difficulties  which  are a major  hindrance 
to the  implementation  of malaria  eradication  programmes  and  to secure  adequate  priority  for  these  programmes  in the allocation  of funds,  it is necessary  to justify  them  on economic  as well  as health  grounds, 
by demonstrating  the  reality�of  the  rapid  and  lasting  advantages  accruing  from  the pursuit  of eradication, 
which  now  seems  to be possible;  and 
Realizing  the importance  of the whole  body  of research  undertaken  on all aspects  of the malaria  problem 
for devising  methods  of interrupting  transmission  suited  to various  ecological  conditions  and  for developing 
more  effective  methods  for  the  prevention,  diagnosis  and  treatment  of malaria, 
1. ENDORSES  the  proposals  contained  in the  report  of the  Director-General  with  regard  to the  strategy 
contemplated  in—countries  where  eradication  programmes  are already  in operation  and  in those  where  areas 
have  reached  the maintenance  phase,  as well  as in countries  which  have  not  yet commenced  their  eradication 
programmes  ； 
2. URGES  the  governments  of countries  with  eradication  programmes  and  the  assisting  agencies  to give 
them  the  necessary  priority  in the allocation  of their  resources  to ensure  the  successful  implementatioiTof 
the programmes  ; 
3. INVITES  the Director-General  to undertake  the necessary  consultations  with  the international  and  bilateral 
assistance  bodies  concerned,  with  a view  to harmonizing  antimalaria  activities  in accordance  with  the revised 
global  strategy  ； 
4. RECOMMENDS 
(a) that  in order  to ensure  the best  prospects  of success  the Organization  continue  to aid the countries 
concerned  in drawing  up long-term  plans  for  malaria  eradication  taking  into  account  not  only  the 
technical,  financial  and  administrative  requirements  of the  attack  and  consolidation  phases,  but  also 
the long-term  needs  for the implementation  of the maintenance  phase,  and  that  in preparing  budgets  it 
indicate  as far as possible,  firstly,  the  sums  allocated  to the development  of the general  health  services 
and,  secondly,  those  earmarked  for  the eradication  programme  itself； 
(b) that  the Organization  continue  to provide  assistance  for the study  of the socio-economic  impact  of 
malaria  and  of its eradication  and  develop  a methodology  for  the  socio-economic  evaluation  of the 
programmes  under  way; 
(c) that  the  Organization  stimulate  and  intensify  multidisciplinary  research  on  malaria  involving 
the biological,  epidemiological,  economic,  social  and  operational  sciences  with  a view  to simplifying 
and improving  methods  of malaria  eradication  as well  as programme  implementation;  and 
4 (d)  that  the  governments  of the  countries  with  programmes  under  way  revise  them  in co-operation 
with  the Organization  and  the other  assisting  agencies  with  a view  to adapting  them  to a strategy  calculated  to give  optimum  results  ； and 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to report  to the Twenty-third  World  Health  Assembly  on the measures 
taken  in pursuance  of this  revised  global  strategy  of malaria  eradication.
