WHA22.47  Diseases  under  Surveillance  : Louse-borne  Typhus,  Louse-borne  Relapsing  Fever,  Viral  Influenza, 
Paralytic  Poliomyelitis 
The Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  recommendations  of the Committee  on International  Quarantine  in its fifteenth 
report,  Volume  A; 
Considering  that  louse-borne  typhus  and  relapsing  fever  have  been  removed  from  the list of diseases 
subject  to the Regulations,  and  that  it is still  of great  importance  to have  a good  knowledge  of the occurrence 
of outbreaks  of these  diseases; 
Considering  that  the risk  of the occurrence  of an epidemic  of viral  influenza  is always  present  and  that 
a knowledge  of the frequently  changing  antigenic  characteristics  of the causal  virus  is necessary  for the preparation  of an effective  vaccine,  and  taking  into  account  the success  of the WHO  influenza  programme  since 
its inception  in 1947; 
Considering  that  poliomyelitis  epidemics  occur  frequently  in areas  where  the child  population  has  not 
been  thoroughly  vaccinated  and  that  the  immune  status  of populations  is constantly  changing,  especially  in 
developing  countries,  owing  to urbanization  and  other  population  movements;  and 
Recognizing  that  an epidemiological  surveillance  programme  based  on speedy  notification  and,  in the 
case of influenza,  rapid  identification  of the virus  strain  involved,  can  be of immense  benefit  in giving  early 
warning  of impending  outbreaks, 
1. REQUESTS  health  administrations  : 
(i) to  inform  the  Organization  promptly  by telegram  or telex  of the occurrence  of any  outbreak  of 
louse-borne  typhus,  louse-borne  relapsing  fever,  viral  influenza  or paralytic  poliomyelitis  in any  areas 
of their  territories  ； and 
(ii) to supplement  these  reports,  as soon  as possible,  by information  on the  source  and  type  of the 
disease  and  the number  of cases  and  deaths;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(i) to  send  to health  administrations,  when  necessary  by means  appropriate  to the  urgency  of the 
situation,  the information  received  in accordance  with  paragraph  1 of this  resolution  ； 
(ii) to publish  such  information  in the Weekly  Epidemiological  Record  and  to dispatch  the  Record  by 
airmail  ； 
(iii) to publish  annually  an epidemiological  study  of the incidence  and  trends  of these  diseases; 
(iv) to publish  information,  whenever  appropriate,  on changes  in these  trends;  and 
(V) to develop  as soon  as possible  A manual  on international  surveillance  of selected  communicable 
diseases  and  to assist  Member  States  in utilizing  their  existing  services  to perform  epidemiological 
surveillance  as effectively  as possible.
