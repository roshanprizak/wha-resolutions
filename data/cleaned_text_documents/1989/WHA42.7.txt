The Forty-second World Health Assembly, Noting with concern that as at 31 December 1988: (a) the rate of collection in 1988 of current year contributions in respect of the effective working budget amounted to 83.88%, being the fourth-lowest rate since the year 1950; (b) only 91 Members had paid their current year contributions to the effective working budget in full, and 44 Members had made no payment towards their current year contributions 1. EXPRESSES concern at the alarming deterioration in the payment of contributions, which has had a deleterious effect on the financial situation during the current financial period; 2. CALLS the attention of all Members to Financial Regulation 5.6, which provides that instalments of contributions and advances shall be considered as due and payable in full by the first day of the year to which they relate, and to the importance of paying contributions as early as possible to enable the Director-General to implement the programme budget in an orderly manner 3. RECALLS that as a result of the adoption by resolution WHA41.12 of an incentive scheme to promote the timely payment of assessed contributions, those Members which will pay their assessed contributions for 1989 and 1990 early in the year in which they are due will have their contributions payable for the programme budget for 1992-1993 reduced, while those Members which continue belate payers will see their contributions payable for the programme budget for 1992-1993 correspondingly increased; 4. URGES Members that systematically make a practice of late payment of contributions to take whatever steps maybe necessary to ensure earlier payment 5. REQUESTS the Director-General to draw the contents of this resolution to the attention of all Members. Twelfth plenary meeting, 17 May 1989 A42 / VR / 12
