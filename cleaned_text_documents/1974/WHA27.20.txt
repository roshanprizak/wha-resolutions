The Twenty-seventh World Health Assembly, Having considered the functions and terms of reference of the Standing Committee on Administration and Finance of the Executive Board, particularly with respect to the Committee's detailed analysis of the financial aspects of the programme and budget estimates, and the Executive Board's recommendations on this subject; Considering that the new form of presentation of the programme and budget estimates makes it difficult to examine separately the financial aspects of the programme proposals and Recognizing the desirability of avoiding duplication of effort, and of improving further the methods of work of the Executive Board, particularly in view of the need for continuity of evaluation of the programme of the Organization, 1. CONSIDERS that the functions of the Standing Committee on Administration and Finance of the Executive Board should be assumed by the Board as a whole, thus obviating the need fora meeting of the Committee prior toa session of the Executive Board during which the programme and budget estimates are reviewed 2. REQUESTS the Executive Board to consider further, at its fifty-fourth session, by which methods and procedures, including the use of the Standing Committee aswell as other committees or working parties as appropriate, it could best undertake its review and analysis of the programme and budget estimates and other matters of particular importance and complexity.
