Whereas it was decided by the First Health Assembly that the Organization should sponsor the observance of World Health Day on 22 July each year by all States Members ; 45 Whereas in every country the schools and other educational institutions could and should act as important focal points for the observance of this day ; Whereas most schools in many countries are closed on 22 July and therefore cannot serve in such manner ; Whereas the date of 7 April, the day when the Constitution of WHO officially entered into force in 1948, provides a suitable alternative without such disadvantages, The Second World Health Assembly RESOLVES that, beginning in 1950 and each year thereafter, World Health Day should appropriately be observed on 7 April by all States Members.
