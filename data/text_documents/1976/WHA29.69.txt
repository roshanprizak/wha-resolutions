its Government  to cooperate  with  it and  particularly  to facilitate  its free  movement  in the occupied  Arab 
territories; 
Reaffirming  resolution  WHA24.33  and  the relevant  provisions  of the Constitution  of WHO  concerning 
the failure  of Members  to meet  their  obligations  to the Organization;
