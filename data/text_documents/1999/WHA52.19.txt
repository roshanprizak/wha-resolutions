The Fifty-second World Health Assembly,
Reca lling resolutions WHA39.27, WHA41.16, WHA43.20, WHA45.27, WHA47.12, WHA47.13 ,
WHA47.16, WHA47.17, and WHA49.14;
Having considered the report of the Director-General on the revised drug strategy;1
Noting  the activities of WHO to further the implementation of the revised drug strategy, in particula r
through  suppo rt to the development and implementation of national drug policies;  the strategy to review an d
assess the effectiveness of the WHO Ethical Criteria for Medicinal Drug Promotion;  the flow of marke t
information;  guidelines for drug donations;  and model drug information;
Recognizing with satisfaction the progress made, and approving WHO’s comp rehensive response to current
and new challenges in the pharmaceutical sector;
Commending the strong leadership s hown by WHO in promoting the essential drugs concept and national
drug policies, which are contributing to the rational  use of resources in the pharmaceutical sector and to improved
health care;
Noting with satisfaction  that a number of Member States have adopted guidelines for drug donations that
are ba sed on the interagency guidelines issued by WHO, but concerned that inappropriate drug donations, such
as donati ons of expired, mislabelled, inessential products, continue to be common, and further concerned tha t
evaluation of the impact of the guidelines has not yet been completed;
Concerned about the situation in which (a) one-third of the world’s population has no guaranteed access
to essential  drugs, and (b) poor quality pharmaceutical raw materials and finished products continue to move in
international trade;
Noting that there are trade issues which require a public health perspective;WHA52.19
2Recognizing that the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Pr operty Rights (TRIPS) provides
scope for the protection of public health;
Taking  note of concerns of many Member States about the impact of relevant international agreements,
including  trade agreements, on local manufacturing capacity and on access to and prices of pharmaceuticals in
developing and least developed countries;
Concerned also that drugs continue to be irrationally used by p rescribers, dispensers and the general public,
and that unethical promotion in developed and developing countries and a lack of access to independent ,
scientifically validated drug information contribute to such abuse,
1. URGES Member States:

to taking all necessary concrete measures in order to ensure equitable access to essential drugs;

(3) to explo re and review their options under relevant international agreements, including trad e
agreements, to safeguard access to essential drugs;
(4) to establish and enforce r egulations that ensure good uniform standards of quality assurance for all
pharmaceutical materi als and products manufactured in, imported to, exported from, or in transit through
their countries;
(5) to enact and enforce legislation or regulat ions in accordance with the principles of the WHO Ethical
Criteria for Medicinal Drug Promotion, to encourage the pharmaceu tical industry and the health community

interagency guidelines issued by WHO and to work with all i nterested parties to promote adherence to such

Promotion and to continue to review its effectiveness with all interested parties;
(3) to extend the guidelines incorporated in the WHO Certification Scheme on the Quality o f
Pharmaceutical Products Moving in International Commerce to cover pharmaceutical starting materials;
to develop and disseminate uniform guidelines on the regulatory control, export, import and transi t

international trade in pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical starting materials;
(4) to establish and develop a model inspec tion certificate for the national inspection of pharmaceutical
manufactu ring sites of starting materials and finished pharmaceutical products in order to ensur e
complia nce with WHO Good Manufacturing Practices, and to collaborate with Member States, at thei r
request, in implementation;
(5) to strengthen and expand the provision of independent information on market prices of startin g
materials of assured quality for production of essential drugs;
(6) to continue the develop ment and dissemination, also using electronic media such as the Internet, of
independent  information on safety of pharmaceutical products and instances of counterfeit drugs o r
medicines, on drug selection and on rational prescribing;
(7) to cooperate with Member States, at their request, and with int ernational organizations in monitoring
and analysing the pharmaceutical and public health implications of relevant international agreements ,

are able to maximize the positive and mitigate the negative impact of those agreements;
(8) to review and update the revised drug strategy to reflect current and continued challenges in th e
