The role of contractual arrangements in improving 
health systems’ performance 
 
The Fifty-sixth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on the role of contractual arrangements in improving health 
systems’ performance,1 
Noting that the performance of health systems must  be strengthened in order further to improve 
the health of populations, ensure equitable financing of health, and meet the le gitimate expectations of 
the population; 
Considering that the reform of health systems h as generally involved institutional restructuring, 
with a diversification of the agents involved in the fi eld of health, in the public and private sectors, and 
among associations; 
Noting that cultural change within health servi ces, such as greater focus on patient needs, a 
broader population-health approach, and emphasis on addressing health inequalities, is often required 
to improve performance, and that health-system cu lture may be unaffected by structural change; 
Recognizing the important role of government stewardship in regulation of contractual 
arrangements in the health sector, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to ensure that contractual arrangements in the field of health adopt rules and principles 
that are in harmony with national health policy; 
(2) to frame contractual policies that maximi ze impact on the performance of health systems 
and harmonize the practices of all parties in a transparent way, to avoid adverse effects; 
(3) to share their experiences on contractual arrangements involving the public and private 
sectors and nongovernmental organizations in the provision of health services;

strengthening capacities and expertise in the development of contractual arrangements;

(4) to facilitate the exchange of experience among Member States; 
(5) to report to the Executive Board at its 117th session and the Fifty-ninth World Health
