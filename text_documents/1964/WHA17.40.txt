WHA17.40  Community  Water  Supply  Programme 
The Seventeenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the Director-General  on community  water  supply;1 
Noting  the  efforts  of countries,  with  the  assistance  of international  organizations,  to develop  water 
supplies  adequate  for agricultural,  industrial  and  public  health  needs; 
Recognizing  that  the progress  to date  in the development  of water  supplies,  while  considerable,  in relation to the magnitude  of the task  has  been  inadequate  to meet  these  needs;  and 
Noting  that  progress  of the community  water  supply  programme  at the desired  rate  will  depend  upon 
additional  and  substantial  resources  being  made  available  for this  purpose  both  at national  and  international 
levels, 
1. ENDORSES  the  principles  for  the  promotion  and  development  of national  programmes  as outlined  in 
the report  of the Director-General  ; 
2. RECOMMENDS  to Member  States  : 
(1) that  greater  emphasis  be given  in national  programmes  to the  provision  of safe  and  adequate 
water  supplies  for communities;  and 
(2) that  full  advantage  be taken  of any  assistance  that  may  be obtainable  from  multilateral  and 
bilateral  agencies  for the carrying  out  of water  supply  programmes; 
3. EXPRESSES  the hope  that  further  substantial  voluntary  contributions  will  be made  to the Special  Account 
by Member  States; 
4. URGES  all multilateral  and  bilateral  financing  agencies  to make  available  the maximum  financial  support 
to national  community  water  supply  programmes; 
5. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to continue  to assist  Member  States  in the  provision  of safe  and 
adequate  water  supplies  for communities,  in particular  by providing  the  necessary  technical  and  advisory 
services  for the development  of such  water  supplies; 
6. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to continue  to co-operate  with  the  United  Nations  and  specialized 
agencies  with  a view  to ensuring  co-ordination  of their  efforts  in this  field  ; and 
7. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to report  on the  progress  of the programme  to the  Nineteenth  World 
Health  Assembly.
