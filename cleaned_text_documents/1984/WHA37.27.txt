AUTHORIZES the Director-General, where necessary for the use of regulatory agencies of Member States, to make additions to or replacements of these international biological preparations, subject in each case to the satisfactory completion of the technical procedures now established of international collaborative studies and assays and under the advice of the members of the Expert Advisory Panel on Biological Standardization or other experts designated to deal with the standardization of particular biological substances; WH37.27 page 2 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to inform Member States periodically when such international biological preparations are established and their international units have been defined; 3. INVITES the Director-General to inquire periodically of Members regarding the use being made of these international standards and other biological preparations in their countries in the control of biological products.

Apparently (Bull. Health Organ. L.o.N. 1935) a standard existed since 1922 but there is no information on the way in which it was defined. The present standard was prepared in Copenhagen in 1934 and is the first one with a clearly defined unitage. 2 Valid equivalent for the synonym Clostridium oedematiens which the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology has now declared invalid (Int. J. System. Bacteriol., 1980, 30, 225). Valid equivalent for ( perfringens) (Clostridium welchii type A antitoxin)- see previous footnote. 4 This serum is also suitable for flocculation. The in vivo to in vitro ratio is 1.4; therefore for practical purposes it maybe assumed that the ampoule contains 1000 Lf- equivalents. LIST I.
