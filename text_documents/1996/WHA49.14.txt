FORTY-NINTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA49.14 
Agenda  item  17 25  May  1996 
Revised  drug  strategy 
The Forty-ninth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA39.27,  WHA41.16，WHA43.20,  WHA45.27,  WHA47.12,  WHA47.13， 
WHA47.16  and WHA47.17; 
Having considered  the report of the Director-General  on the revised drug strategy;1 
Noting the activities  of WHO to further the implementation  of the revised drug strategy,  in particular, 
the high priority given to direct country support  and collaboration  in drug policy formulation  and 
implementation,  provision  and dissemination  of independent  drug information,  improved  training of health 
personnel,  promotion  of collaborative  research,  and strengthening  of drug regulatory  mechanisms; 
Recognizing  with satisfaction  the increasing  awareness  of all parties concerned  of their responsibilities, 
in the implementation  of the revised drug strategy; 
Aware that WHO's strong leadership  in promoting  the essential  drugs concept and its efforts to 
coordinate  the growing number of those concerned  in the pharmaceutical  sector have been vital in promoting 
rational drug use; 
Concerned  that access to drugs is still inequitable,  that promotion  of commercially  produced  drugs still 
outweighs  independent,  comparative,  scientifically  validated  and up-to-date  information  on drugs, and that 
problems  persist in ensuring  the quality of medicines  both on the open market and for donation  as 
international  aid; 
Aware that effective  drug regulation  takes time; 
Aware also that economic  conditions,  including  the changing  share of the public and private sectors in 
health care, demand a wise use of available  resources  to meet drug needs for primary health care, 
1. URGES  Member  States: 
(1) to reaffirm their commitment  to develop and implement  national drug policies to ensure equitable 
access to essential  drugs; 世界術生大會.•決議  .--^^JUHiôa^Hi^jy—'
