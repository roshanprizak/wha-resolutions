WHA16.25  Television  Influence  on Youth 
The Sixteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Aware  of the great  influence  of television  programmes  and  of the risk  that  those  based  on violence  and 
crime  may  adversely  affect  mental  health,  particularly  of the younger  viewers; 
Taking  into  account  the need  to obtain  a scientific  assessment  of the effects  of such  programmes;  and 
Mindful  of the different  measures  taken  by governments  to secure  the avoidance  of harmful  influences, 
1. STRESSES  the educational  value  of television,  with  special  regard  to programmes  in the  field  of health 
education  and  medical  training;  and 
2. RECOMMENDS  that  national  health  authorities  encourage  the study  of television  influence  on mental  health, 
particularly  of children  and  young  adults.
