In view  of the fact  that  the first  report  on the world  health  situation  is being  prepared  for the Eleventh 
World  Health  Assembly  ; 
Conscious  that  during  the  period  that  has  elapsed,  the  World  Health  Organization  has  acquired

its position  in the  United  Nations  family,  its role  has  increased  in importance  ; 
Conscious  that,  despite  the  important  results  obtained  by the  World  Health  Organization,  extensive 
health  problems  still  exist  whose  rapid  solution  is essential  if conditions  of economic  stability  and  social 
well-being  are  to be established  ; 
Taking  into  account  the  fact  that  the  favourable  development  of the  international  situation  creates 
new possibilities  and  opens  fresh  perspectives  for  undertaking  still  more  intensive  activities  to ensure  the 
attainment  by all peoples  of the highest  possible  level  of health  ;
