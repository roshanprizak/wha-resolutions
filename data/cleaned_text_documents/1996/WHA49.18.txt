e The Forty-ninth World Health Assembly, Recognizing that controlled drugs, such as opioid analgesics, are essential medicines for the treatment of human suffering; Also recognizing that timely international supplies of essential medicines are often vital for humanitarian disaster relief operations in emergency situations; Concerned because speedy international supply of opioid analgesics to sites of emergencies is impossible because of the export and import control measures that apply to narcotic drugs; Concerned further about the similar difficulties experienced even with regard to psychotropic substances, as an increasing number of national authorities apply stricter control measures than are provided under the relevant international treaty; Noting, with satisfaction, that the International Narcotics Control Board shares such concern; Convinced that a practical solution to this problem should be found through intensified dialogue between the health and drug control authorities at all levels, 1. URGES Member States to initiate or intensify dialogue between health and drug control authorities in order to establish simplified regulatory procedures that allow timely international supply of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in emergency situations; 2.
