The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Mindful  of the basic  principle  established  in the WHO  Constitution,  which  affirms  that the health  of all 
peoples  is fundamental  to the attainment  of peace  and security; 
Seriously  concerned  by violations  of human  rights  in the occupied  Arab  territories; 
Recalling  the need  for the occupying  power  to observe  strictly  its obligations  under  the Fourth  Geneva 
Convention  (1949),  to which  it has notably  not conformed  in such basic  areas  as health; 
Aware  of its responsibility  for ensuring  proper  health  conditions  for all people  who are victims  of 
exceptional  situations,  including  settlements  that are contrary  to the Fourth  Geneva  Convention  of 1949; 
Recognizing  the need  for increased  support  and assistance  for the Palestinian  people,  as well as the 
Syrian  Arab  people  in the Golan  under  Israeli  occupation,  and for stronger  cooperation  with them; 
Expressing  its deep  concern  at the negative  effects  of the practices  of the occupying  power  against  the 
Palestinian  people  in the field of health  during  the Intifada,  at a time when  social  and economic  conditions  in 
the territories  were  deteriorating; 
Expressing  deep  satisfaction  at the commencement  of peace  talks  among  the parties  concerned  in the 
Middle  East,  starting  with the Madrid  Conference  and continuing  in the peace  negotiations  between  the said 
parties; 
Expressing  the hope  that these  talks  will lead to a just and comprehensive  peace  in the Middle  East, 
based  on the principles  of international  legitimacy  and, in particular,  on relevant  United  Nations  resolutions; 
Regretting  the refusal  of the Israeli  authorities  to allow  the Special  Committee  of Experts  to visit the 
occupied  Arab  territories; 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on the health  conditions  of the Arab  population  in 
the occupied  Arab  territories,  including  Palestine,1

2. EXPRESSES  THE  HOPE  that the peace  talks  will lead quickly  to a just, lasting  and comprehensive 
peace  in the Middle  East,  so that the Palestinian  people  can develop  their  health  plans  and projects  to 
participate  with the peoples  of the world  in the achievement  of WHO's  objective  of "Health  for All by the 
Year 2000й;

4. STRESSES  that the policies  of the Israeli  authorities  in the occupied  Arab  territories  are not consistent

territories,  and that it is the role of the international  community  in its contribution  to the peace  process  to 
assist the Palestinian  people  in their  efforts  to enjoy  this basic  human  right  and the privilege  of being 
responsible  for their  own health  system; 
5. DEPLORES  the continuing  deterioration  of the situation  in the occupied  Arab  territories,  which 
seriously  affects  the living  conditions  of the people,  compromises  in a lasting  fashion  the future  of the 
Palestinian  society,  and prevents  the economic  and social  development  of those  territories; 
6. EXPRESSES  ITS DEEP  CONCERN  at the Israeli  refusal  to permit  the Special  Committee  of Experts 
to visit the occupied  Arab  territories,  requesting  that Israel  allow  the Committee  to fulfil  its mission  of 
investigating  the health  conditions  of the populations  in those  territories; 
7. THANKS  the Chairman  of the Special  Committee  of Experts  for his note and requests  the Special

the occupied  Arab  territories  to the Forty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly; 
8. RECALLS  resolutions  WHA42.14,  WHA43.26  and WHA44.31  and commends  the Organization's  efforts 
to prepare  and implement  the special  technical  assistance  to improve  the health  conditions  of the Palestinian 
people  in the occupied  Arab  territories; 
9. THANKS  the Director-General  for his efforts,  requesting  him, in the light of relevant  Health  Assembly 
resolutions:

(3) to monitor  and evaluate  the health  conditions  of the Arab  population  in the occupied  Arab 
territories,  in particular  the proposals  contained  in the reports  of the Special  Committee  of Everts,  and

available  measures  in this regard,  and to assist  the Palestinian  people  in developing  health  manpower 
capable  of shouldering  the responsibility  of their  health;
