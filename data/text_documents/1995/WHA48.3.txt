Recognizing  that  poverty  is the most  fundamental  obstacle  to health  and  overall  development  and  a 
permanent  menace  to world  peace; 
Emphasizing  that  an effective  response  is dependent  on country-specific  approaches; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA42.3,  WHA43.17  and WHA46.30  on strengthening  technical  and economic 
support  to countries  facing  serious  economic  constraints; 
Recognizing  the essential  role  of coordinated  technical  support  from  all levels  of the Organization  in 
intensified  cooperation  with  countries  in greatest  need, 
1. URGES  Member  States: 
(1) to  consider  measures  to alleviate  poverty  and  its health  effects  as essential  to progress  towards 
health  for all and  development; 
(2) to  give  much  greater  attention  to strengthening  their  capacity  for health  development,  setting 
time-limits  and  targets  for achievement; 
(3) to  establish  integrated  strategies  for health  development,  to institutionalize  effective  systems  to 
coordinate  all efforts  and resources,  internal  and  external,  mobilized  for their  implementation,  and 
develop  more  effective  management  tools  in order  to maximize  efficiency; 
2. CALLS  ON  the international  community:

(2) to  place  particular  emphasis  on strengthening  the capacity  of countries  in greatest  need  to initiate 
the process  of health  development,  drawing  in the first  instance  on national  expertise  and  in addition 
on that  of other  developing  and  developed  countries  with  appropriate  experience; 
(3) to  strengthen  collaboration  with  countries  and  with  WHO  in ensuring  that  resources  made 
available  are used  to meet  national  priorities  as determined  by the countries  themselves; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to  accord  high  priority  to providing  a well-coordinated,  country-specific  WHO  response  to more 
countries  in greatest  need,  allocating  financial  and technical  resources  according  to criteria  of income, 
health  status  and national  capacity  and  willingness  of Governments  to meet  health  development  needs, 
setting  clearly-defined  strategies,  time-limits  and  targets  for achievement,  and  strengthening  the WHO 
country  offices  in more  countries  so that  the staff  have  the technical  competence  and  expertise  to 
provide  the necessary  advice  and  leadership  to the national  Governments; 
(2) to  continue  to reorient  the structure  and functions  at all levels  of the Organization,  and  strengthen 
the technical  and  managerial  capacities  in order  to support  WHO'S  intensified  cooperation  with 
countries,  using  the country-centred  approach  in the process  of reform; 
(3) to  place  renewed  emphasis  on cooperation  with  these  countries  in strengthening  their  capacity  to 
develop  and implement  health  development  policies  based  on community  participation  which  remove 
inequities  in the health  field,  using  intersectoral  measures  to promote  economic  and  social  development 
and improve  financing  and  management  of the health  system  at all levels; 
(4) to  intensify  efforts  to mobilize,  coordinate  and  manage  external  resources,  including  human 
resources  from  countries  that  have  emerged  successfully  from  the state  of a developing  country  to a 
developed  one,  and to make  available  the maximum  resources  for health  development  in the countries 
in greatest  need; 
(5) to  report  at regular  intervals  to the Executive  Board  and Health  Assembly  on progress  achieved 
in implementing  this  resolution.
