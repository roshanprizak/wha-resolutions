Having considered the report on the status of collection of assessed contributions, including Member States in arrears in the payment of their contributions to an extent that would justify invoking Article 7 of the Constitution;1 Noting that Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Suriname and Yemen were in arrears at the time of the opening of the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly to such an extent that it was necessary for the Health Assembly to consider, in accordance with Article 7 of the Constitution, whether the voting privileges of those countries should be suspended at the opening of the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly in 2021, DECIDES: (1) that since at the time of the opening of the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Suriname and Yemen were still in arrears in the payment of their contributions to an extent that would justify invoking Article 7 of the Constitution, their voting privileges shall be suspended as from the time that this resolution is adopted; (2) that the suspension that takes effect as set out in paragraph (1) above shall continue at the Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly and subsequent Health Assemblies, until the arrears of Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Suriname and Yemen have been reduced to a level below the amount that would justify invoking Article 7 of the Constitution; (3) that this decision shall be without prejudice to the right of any Member to request restoration of its voting privileges in accordance with Article 7 of the Constitution.
