WHA17.21  Presentation  of Future  Programmes  and  Budget  Estimates 
The Seventeenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  noted  the  programme  and  budget  estimates  presented  by the  Director-General; 
Considering  the  need  to extend  the  activities  of the  Organization  in order  to meet  the  increasing 
requirements  of world  health;  and 
Considering  the  views  expressed  by the  Executive  Board  at its thirty-third  session  on the  desirability 
of having  programme  proposals  presented  in such  a way  as to give  an overall  picture  and  trend  of the  work 
of the  Organization  wherever  possible, 
REQUESTS  the  Director-General  and  the  Executive  Board  to consider  the  possibility  of progressively 
presenting  future  programmes  and  budgets  in a functional  form  and  in a way  that  will  permit  the  total 
activities  in a particular  field  to be seen  comprehensively.
