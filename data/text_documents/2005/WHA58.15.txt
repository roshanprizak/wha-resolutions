 WHA58.15 Global immunization strategy 
The Fifty-eighth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on the draft immunization strategy;1 
Alarmed that globally and in some region s immunization coverage had increased only 
marginally since the early 1990s, and that in 2003 more than 27 million children worldwide were not 
immunized during their first year of life; 
Recognizing that each year 1.4 million children  under five years of age die from diseases 
preventable by currently available vaccines; 
Further recognizing that each year an additional 2.6 million children under five years of age die 
from diseases potentially preventable by new vaccines; 
Acknowledging the contributions of WHO, UNICEF, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and 
Immunization (GAVI) and all partners in their effo rts to strengthen immunization services, expand 
immunization coverage and introduce new and underused vaccines in developing countries; 
Welcoming the achievements of th e accelerated disease-control in itiatives against poliomyelitis, 
measles, and maternal and neonatal tetanus in immunizing previously unreached populations, and 
noting that these initiatives have established extensive networks on which surveillance for other 
disease and health trends can be built or expanded; 
Concerned that, owing to financial, structural  and/or managerial constraints, national 
immunization programmes fail to reach all who are eligible for immunization, particularly  children 
and women, underuse many existing vaccines, and are not widely introducing new vaccines; 
Emphasizing the need for all countries to strive  towards achieving the internationally agreed  
development goal contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration  of reducing by two-thirds, 
between 1990 and 2015, the under-five child mortality rate; 
Recalling the target adopted at the United Nations General Assembly’s twenty-seventh special 
session on children (2002) to ensure full immunization of children under one year of age, at 90% 
coverage nationally, with at least 80% coverage in  every district or equivalent administrative unit;2 
Recognizing that resolution WHA53.12 highlights immunization as a major factor in promoting 
child health; 
Having considered the draft global  immunization vision and strategy,3

 2. URGES Member States: 
(1) to meet immunization targets expressed in the United Nations General Assembly special 
session on children; 
(2) to adopt the Global Immunization Vision and  Strategy as the framework for strengthening 
of national immunization programmes between 2006 and 2015, with the goal of achieving 
greater coverage and  equity in access to immunizations, of improving access to existing and 
future vaccines, and of extending the benefits of vaccination linked with other health 
interventions to age groups beyond infancy; 
(3) to ensure that immunization remains a pr iority on the national health agenda, and is 
supported by systematic planning, implementatio n, monitoring and evaluation processes, and 
long-term financial commitment; 
3. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to mobilize resources to promote the availability and affordability in countries of future 
new vaccines based on evidence of epidemiological profiles; 
(2) to work closely with UNICEF, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization 
(GAVI) and other partners to provide support to Member States in implementation of the Global 
Immunization Vision and Strategy; 
(3) to strengthen relations at global, regional  and subregional levels with UNICEF, GAVI 
and other partners in order to mobilize the n eeded resources for countries, in particular 
developing countries,  to implement the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy; 
(4) to report every three years to the Health Assembly on progress towards achievement of 
global immunization targets, including that adopted at the United Nations General Assembly 
special session on children.
