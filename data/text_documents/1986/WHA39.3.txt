THIRTY-NINTH  WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY 
Agenda item 32.2 
STATUS OF COLLECTION  OF ASSESSED  CONTRIBUTIONS  AND STATUS OF 
ADVANCES TO THE WORKING CAPITAL FUND 
The Thirty-ninth  World Health Assembly, 
Noting with concern that as at 31 December  1985: 
(a) the rate of collection  of contributions  in respect of the effective  working budget 
amounted to 90.90%, being the second lowest rate achieved  in the 10-year period 1976 to 
1985; and 
(b) only 83 Members had paid their current year contributions  to the effective  working 
budget in full, representing  the lowest number of such Members during that 10-year 
period, and 48 Members had made no payment towards their current year contributions; 
Noting further  that 27 Members systematically  made no payment towards  their current year 
contributions  in each of the three years 1983, 1984 and 1985; 
Further noting that, as at 30 September  1985, 43.84% of current year contributions  for 
the effective  working budget remained  unpaid； 
1. EXPRESSES  concern  at the deteriorating  trend in the payment of contributions  over the 
10-year period 1976 to 1985; 
2. CALLS THE ATTENTION  of Members to the importance  of paying their contributions  as early 
as possible  in the year to which they relate； 
3. REQUESTS  Members that have not yet done so to provide in their national  budgets for the 
payment to the World Health Organization  of their contributions  when due, in accordance  with 
Financial  Regulation  5.6, which provides  that instalments  of contributions  and advances  shall 
be considered  as due and payable in full by the first day of the year to which they relate; 
4. URGES Members that systematically  make a practice  of late payment of contributions  to 
take whatever  steps may be necessary  to ensure earlier payment； 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to draw the contents  of this resolution  to the attention 
of all Members. WHA39.3
