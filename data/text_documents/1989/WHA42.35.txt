The Forty-second  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA30.32  and WHA38.30,  which led to the implementation  of a 
long-term  programme  in the field of cardiovascular  diseases  with special  emphasis  on 
research  in the field of prevention,  etiology,  early detection,  treatment  and 
rehabilitation,  as well as on international  cooperation  in the field of community  control 
of cardiovascular  diseases  and other chronic  noneommuniсab1e  diseases； 
Considering  that sufficient  information  now exists to prevent  and control 
cardiovascular  and other noneommuniсable  diseases  from childhood  through  adulthood; 
Emphasizing  the crucial  importance  of the optimal  use and cost-effective  management 
of the limited  available  resources； 
Emphasizing,  further,  the increase  in the number of cases of cardiovascular  and 
other chronic  noneommuniсable  diseases  in developing  countries； 
Taking into account  the proposals  made by the two WHO expert committees  - on 
appropriate  diagnostic  technology  in the management  of cardiovascular  diseases,  and on 
the prevention  in childhood  and youth of adult cardiovascular  diseases  - regarding  the 
need to apply subsequent  findings  in both the health and various  other sectors；
