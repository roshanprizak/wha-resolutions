WHA2.60.  Budget  Estimates  for the proposed  1950  Programme 
The Second  World  Health  Assembly 
(1) TAKES  NOTE  of the  resolution  adopted  in plenary  session  on 16 June  1949  which 
provides  for the  Committee  on Administration  and  Finance  to cost  the  programme 
approved  by the  Committee  on Programme  ; 61 
(2) UNDERSTANDS  that  the  costing  of the  programme  does  not  in any  way  commit  the 
committee  to a total  budget  and  that  consideration  of the total  budget  will  be undertaken 
by the  Committees  on Programme  and  Administration  and  Finance  in joint  session  ; 
(3) BELIEVES  it desirable  in order  to expedite  the consideration  of the budget  for 1950, 
to adopt  a procedure  which  should  not establish  a precedent  for future  years  and,  therefore, 
(4) DECIDES  that  the  costs  of the  programme  provided  by the  Director-General  are 
hereby  accepted  ; and  further 
(5) REQUESTS  the  Executive  Board  to take  note  of the  discussion  in the  Committee 
on Administration  and  Finance  and  give  special  consideration  to the  problem  which 
has developed  at this  Assembly  with  the  view  of recommending  a more  satisfactory 
procedure  for the Third  Health  Assembly.62
