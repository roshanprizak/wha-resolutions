112 FIFTY-EIGHTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY 
 
   
 WHA58.24 Sustaining the elimination of  iodine deficiency disorders 
The Fifty-eighth World Health Assembly, 
Having taken note of WHO’s report on iodine status worldwide;1 
Affirming the priority of preventing and controlling iodine deficiency disorders contained in 
resolutions WHA49.13 and WHA52.24, and the elimination target set by the United Nations General Assembly twenty-seventh special session on children (2002);
2 
Concerned that iodine deficiency disorders remain  a serious public-health threat in that they 
cause invisible brain damage to hundreds of millions of children as well as visible goitre, cretinism, 
stillbirth, miscarriage and physical impairment; 
Noting that the global battle against iodine deficiency disorders through universal salt iodization 
constitutes one of the most cost-effective interventions, contributing to economic and social 
development; 
Recognizing that the final choice on a measure should always be defined taking into account the 
degree of iodine deficiency in order to manage the ri sk of excessive iodine intake in the most sensitive 
populations, namely children; 
Noting resolution WHA57.17 on the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, and 
the necessity that action in respect of iodine de ficiency should be compatible with the strategy 
recommendation to limit salt (sodium) consumption from all sources; 
Recognizing that in the past decade 2000 million more people have adopted the use of iodized 
salt, but that despite that substantial progress fully one third of the world’s population still remain at 
risk, mostly in the poorest and economically least developed areas; 
Realizing that a sustainable solution such as universal salt iodization is needed in order to 
maintain the regular intake of trace amounts of iodine, because deficiency disorders cannot be eradicated, and interruption of such regular intake paves the way for their return; 
Convinced that sustainability of control activities requires communication and public education 
in order to maintain the continuing use of iodized salt and to avoid the reappearance of deficiency 
disorders in the absence of long-term control strategies; 
Applauding the establishment in 2002 of the global Network for Sustainable Elimination of 
Iodine Deficiency as a model of public/private collaboration among stakeholders for a worldwide 
effort, in which a number of salt associations  are founding members along with international 
development agencies and Kiwanis International,

2 United Nations General Assembly resolutions S-27/2, Annex.  RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 113 
 
 
 
 
 
 (1) to strengthen their commitment to sustained elimination of iodine deficiency disorders as 
part of their regular health programmes and antipoverty efforts including  through universal salt 
iodization; 
(2) to take urgent measures to reach the remaining one third of the world population, mostly 
the poorest and economically disadvantaged groups; 
(3) to include health promotion in their control strategies so that the use of iodized salt 
becomes a standard practice based on awareness of the need for iodine in the diet in order to 
ensure physical and mental  well-being, especially for expectant and breastfeeding mothers and 
infants and young children; 
(4) to establish multidisciplinary national coalitions that include the  salt industry (salt  
producers, distributors  and retailers), and the education and media sectors, in order to monitor 
the state of iodine nutrition every three years and to report to the Health Assembly on progress; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to strengthen cooperation with Member St ates, at their request, with international 
organizations, including UNICEF, bilateral aid agencies and international bodies such as the 
International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, the Micronutrient Initiative, 
and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, in  providing technical assistance to regulators 
and salt producers in producing and marketing iodized salt, strengthening quality-control 
systems, and facilitating a network of reference laboratories for estimation of iodine intake; 
(2) to strengthen advocacy efforts involving public media and civil society for renewed 
commitment to combating iodine deficiency disorders, including appropriate research with 
relevant partners; 
(3) to report on implementation of this resolution to the Sixtieth World Health Assembly, and 
every three years  thereafter.
