The Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  studied  the  proposed  programme  and  budget  estimates  for 1975  1 and  the  Director-General's 
Annual  Report  for 1973;  2 
Recalling  that  leprosy  is still  a widespread  and  serious  disease;  and 
Considering  that  the new  microbiological  techniques,  particularly  animal  inoculation,  and  immunological 
methods  as well  as the development  of new  epidemiological  approaches  seem  likely  to speed  up leprosy  control 
and make  it more  effective, 
1. THANKS  the Director-General  for  his report  and  requests  him  to pursue  the efforts  for leprosy  control 
undertaken  by WHO  ； 
2. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  States  examine  the possibility  of strengthening  leprosy  control  measures  by 
calling  upon  all available  sources  of cooperation; 
3. INVITES  Member  States  to have  recourse  to the  Organization's  advisory  and  coordinatory  services  so 
that optimum  use  can  be made  of these  extra  resources  ； and 
4. INVITES  the Director-General  to convene  A meeting  of the WHO  Expert  Committee  on Leprosy  to review 
the practical  introduction  of modern  methods  of leprosy  control.
