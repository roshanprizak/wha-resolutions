The Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report on poliomyelitis: intensification of the global eradication initiative; 1 Recalling resolution WHA61.1 on poliomyelitis: mechanism for management of potential risks to eradication, which requested the Director-Genera l, inter alia, to develop anew strategy to reinvigorate the fight to eradicate poliovirus and to develop appropriate strategies for managing the long-term risks of reintroduction of poliovirus and re-emergence of poliomyelitis, including the eventual cessation of use of oral poliovirus vaccine in routine immunization programmes; Recognizing the need to make rapidly available the necessary financial resources to eradicate the remaining circulating polioviruses and to minimize the risks of reintroduction of poliovirus and r eemergence of poliomyelitis after interruption of wild poliovirus transmission; Noting the finding of the Independent Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in its report of October 2011 that polio simply will not be eradicated unless it receives a higher priority in many of the polio-affected cou ntries, and across the world 2 and its recommendation in its April 2011 report that the World Health Assembly considers a resolution to declare the persistence of polio a global health em ergency; Noting the report of the meeting in November 2011 of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization at which it stated unequivocally that the risk of failure to finish global polio eradication constitutes a programmatic emergency of global proportions for public health and is not acceptable under any circumstances; Recognizing the need for Member States to engage all levels of political and civil society so as to ensure that all children are vaccinated in order to eradicate poliomyelitis; Having noted the current high cost and limited supp lies of inactivated polio vaccine that are hampering the introduction and scaling-up of inacti vated polio vaccine, resulting in major programmatic and financial implications to developi ng countries; 1 Document A65 / 20. 2 Polio eradication. Weekly epidemiological record , 2012, 87 (1):116. WHA65.5 2 Noting that the technical feasibility of poliovirus eradication has been proved through the full application of new strategic approaches; Noting that continuing poliovirus transmission anywhere will continue to pose a risk to poliomyelitis-free areas until such time as all pol iovirus transmission is interrupted globally, 1. DECLARES the completion of poliovirus na programmatic emergency for global public health, requiring the full implementation of current and new eradication strategies, the institution of strong national oversight and accountability mechanisms for all areas affected by poliovirus, and the application of appropriate vaccination recommendations for all travellers to and from areas affected with poliovirus; 1 2. URGES Member States with poliovirus transmission to declare such transmission tobe a national public health emergency making polioviru s eradication a national priority programme, requiring the development and full implementation of emergency action plans, tobe updated every six months, until such time as poliovirus transmission has been interrupted; 3. URGES all Member States: (1) to eliminate the unimmunized areas and to maintain very high population immunity against polioviruses through routine immunization p rogrammes and, where necessary, supplementary immunization activities; (2) to maintain vigilance for poliovirus importatio ns, and the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses, by achieving and sustaining certification-standard surveillance and regular risk assessment for polioviruses; (3) to make available urgently the financial resour ces required for the full and continued implementation, to the end of 2013, of the necessary strategic approaches to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission globally, and to initiate p lanning for the financing to the end of 2018 of the polio endgame strategy; (4) to engage in multilateral and bilateral coopera tion, including exchanging epidemiological information, laboratory monitoring data, and carrying out supplementary immunization activities simultaneously as appropriate; 4. REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to plan for the renewed implementation through 2013 of the approaches to eradicating wild polioviruses outlined in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Strategic Plan 20102012 and any new tactics that are deemed necessary complete eradication, including the enhancement of the existing global polio eradication initiative within the Organization; (2) to strengthen accountability and monitoring mec hanisms to ensure optimal implementation of eradication strategies at all lev els; (3) to undertake the development, scientific vettin g, and rapid finalization of a comprehensive polio eradication and endgame strateg y, and inform Member States of the 1 International travel and health . Geneva, World Health Organization, 2012 edition. WHA65.5 3 potential timing of a switch from trivalent to bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine for all routine immunization programmes; and include budget scenari os to the end of 2018 that include risk management; (4) to coordinate with all relevant partners, inclu ding vaccine manufacturers, to promote the research, production and supply of vaccines, in particular inactivated polio vaccines, in order to enhance their affordability, effectiveness and acce ssibility; (5) to continue mobilizing and deploying the necessary financial and human resources for the strategic approaches required through 2013 for wild poliovirus eradication, and for the eventual implementation of a polio endgame strategy to end of 2018; (6) to report to the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly and the subsequent two Health Assemblies, through the Executive Board, on sin implementing this resolution.
