Agenda item 13.2 25 May 2012 
The global burden of mental disorders and the need 
for a comprehensive, coordinated response from 
health and social sectors at the country level 
 
The Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on the global burden o f mental disorders and the need for a 
comprehensive, coordinated response from health and  social sectors at the country level; 1  
Recalling resolution WHA55.10, which, inter alia, u rged Member States to increase investments 
in mental health, both within countries and in bila teral and multilateral cooperation, as an integral 
component of the well-being of populations;  
Recalling further United Nations General Assembly r esolution 65/95, which recognized that 
mental health problems are of major importance to a ll societies and are significant contributors to th e 
burden of disease and the loss of quality of life, and have huge economic and social costs, and which 
also welcomed the WHO report on mental health and d evelopment that highlighted the lack of 
appropriate attention to mental health and made the  case for governments and development actors to 
reach out to people with mental disorders in the de sign of strategies and programmes that include 
those people in education, employment, health, soci al protection and poverty reduction policies; 
Noting the High-level Meeting of the United Nations  General Assembly on the Prevention and 
Control of Non-communicable Diseases (New York, 19 and 20 September 2011), at which it was 
recognized that mental and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, are an important 
cause of morbidity and contribute to the global non communicable disease burden, necessitating 
provision of equitable access to effective programm es and health-care interventions; 
Recognizing that mental disorders can lead to disab ilities, as reflected in the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabiliti es, which also notes that disability results from t he 
interaction between persons with impairments and at titudinal and environmental barriers that hinder 
their full and effective participation in society o n an equal basis with others, and that the World report 
on disability  2011  charts the steps that are required to improve the participation and inclusion of 
people with disabilities, including those with ment al disabilities; 
Recognizing also that mental disorders fall within a wider spectrum that includes neurological 
and substance-use disorders, which also cause subst antial disability and require a coordinated respons e 
from health and social sectors;

2 Concerned that millions of people worldwide are aff ected by mental disorders, and that in 2004, 
mental disorders accounted for 13% of the global bu rden of disease, defined as premature death 
combined with years lived with disability, and also  that, when taking into consideration only the 
disability component of the burden of disease calcu lation, mental disorders accounted for 25.3% and 
33.5% of all years lived with a disability in low- and middle-income countries, respectively; 
Concerned also that exposure to humanitarian emerge ncies is a potent risk factor for mental 
health problems and psychological trauma and that s ocial structures and ongoing formal and informal 
care of persons with severe, pre-existing, mental d isorders are disrupted;  
Recognizing further that the treatment gap for ment al disorders is large all over the world, that 
between 76% and 85% of people with severe mental di sorders in low- and middle-income countries 
receive no treatment for their mental health condit ions, and that the corresponding figures for highincome countries are also high – between 35% and 50 %; 
Recognizing in addition that a number of mental dis orders can be prevented and that mental 
health can be promoted in the health sector and in sectors outside health; 
Concerned that persons with mental disorders are of ten stigmatized, and underlining the need 
for health authorities to work with relevant groups  to change attitudes to mental disorders; 
Noting also that there is increasing evidence on th e effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
interventions to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders, particularly in children and 
adolescents; 
Noting further that mental disorders are often asso ciated with noncommunicable diseases and a 
range of other priority health issues, including HI V/AIDS, maternal and child health, and violence and  
injuries, and that mental disorders often coexist w ith other medical and social factors, such as pover ty, 
substance abuse and the harmful use of alcohol, and , in the case of women and children, greater 
exposure to domestic violence and abuse; 
Recognizing that certain populations live in a situ ation that makes them particularly vulnerable 
to developing mental disorders, and the consequence s thereof; 
Recognizing also that the social and economic impac t of mental disorders, including mental 
disabilities, is diverse and far-reaching; 
Taking into account the work already carried out by  WHO on mental health, particularly 
through its Mental Health Gap Action Programme,
