The Thirty-sixth  World Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that the front-line  States  and Lesotho  continue  to be targets  of sustained

destabilize  their governments,  and which hamper  their economic  and social  development;

(2) to report  to the Thirty-seventh  World Health  Assembly  on the progress  made in the
