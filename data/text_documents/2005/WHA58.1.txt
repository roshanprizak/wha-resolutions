WHA58.1 Health action in relation to crises and disasters, with particular 
emphasis on the earthquakes and tsunamis of 26 December 2004 
The Fifty-eighth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the reports on health action in relation to crises and disasters;1 
Regretting the profound human consequences of the earthquakes and tsunamis that on 
26 December 2004 struck many countries, from south-east Asia to east Africa, causing an estimated 280 000 deaths, with thousands more still missing, injuring as many as half a million people, and 
making at least five million people homeless and/or deprived of adequate access to safe drinkingwater, sanitation, food or health services;  
Noting that citizens of more than 30 countries were affected by the disaster, and that those who 
died included many health professionals; 
Acknowledging that most relief assistance has initially been, and will continue to be, provided 
from within affected communities and through local authorities, supported through intense 
international cooperation, and expecting that these communities will continue to experience serious difficulties as a result of the loss of their means of livelihood, overloading of health and social 
services, and both immediate and long-term psychological trauma;  
Recognizing that action to address the public health aspects of crises should at all times 
strengthen the ingenuity and resilience of communities, the capacities of local authorities, the 
preparedness of health systems, and the ability of national authorities and civil society to provide 
prompt and coordinated back-up geared to the survival of those immediately affected; 
Appreciating the generous assistance provided to the affected nations by governments, 
nongovernmental groups, individuals, and national public-health institutions, including through the 
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network; 
Acknowledging the difficulties faced by under-resourced local health systems in locating 
missing persons, identifying those who have died, and managing the bodies of the deceased;  
Recognizing the challenges faced by overwhelmed local authorities as they coordinate the relief 
effort, including personnel and goods generously made available as a result of both national and 
international solidarity; 
Noting that the effectiveness with which affected nations respond to sudden events of this scale 
reflects their preparedness and readiness for focused and concerted action, particularly in relation to saving life and sustaining survival;

Recalling that more than 30 countries worldwide are currently facing major, often longstanding, crises, with as many as 500 million persons at risk because they face a variety of avoidable 
threats to their survival and well-being, and that around 20 other countries are at high risk of serious 
natural or man-made events, increasing the number of persons at risk to between 2000 million and 
3000 million;  
Appreciating that analyses of health needs a nd performance of health systems, within the 
context of national policies and internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, are essential for the proper rehabilitation and recovery of 
equitable individual and public health services, and that this task is best undertaken if there are clear 
synergies between preparedness and response; 
Reaffirming the need to build local capacity to as sess risks, and to prepare for, and respond to, 
any future catastrophe, including by providing continuous public education, dispelling myths about health consequences of disasters, and reducing the risk of disaster damage in critical health facilities;  
Recognizing that improvement of social and economic circumstances of the most disadvantaged 
countries is a preventive action that reduces the risk of crises and disasters and their consequences; 
Taking into account the outcomes of the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (Kobe, 
Hyogo, Japan, 18 to 22 January 2005),
