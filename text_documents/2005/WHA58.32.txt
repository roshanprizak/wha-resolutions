136 FIFTY-EIGHTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY 
 
   
 WHA58.32 Infant and young child nutrition 
The Fifty-eighth World Health Assembly, 
Recalling the adoption by the Health Assembly of the International Code of Marketing of 
Breast-milk Substitutes annexed to reso lution WHA34.22, resolutions WHA39.28, WHA41.11, 
WHA46.7, WHA47.5, WHA49.15, WHA54.2 on infant and y oung child nutrition, appropriate feeding 
practices and related questions,  and particularly resolution WHA55.25, which endorses the global 
strategy for infant and young child feeding; 
Having considered the report on infant and young child nutrition;1 
Aware that the joint FAO/WHO expert meeting on Enterobacter sakazakii  and other 
microorganisms in powdered infant formula (2004)  concluded that intrinsic contamination of 
powdered infant formula with E. sakazakii  and Salmonella  had been a cause of infection and illness, 
including severe disease in infants, particularly preterm, low birth-weight or immunocompromised 
infants, and could lead to serious developmental sequelae and death;2 
Noting that such severe outcomes are especially  serious in preterm, low birth-weight and 
immunocompromised infants, and therefore are of concern to all Member States; 
Bearing in mind that the Codex Alimentarius Co mmission is revising its recommendations on 
hygienic practices for the manufacture of foods for infants and young children; 
Recognizing the need for parents and caregivers to be fully informed of evidence-based publichealth risks of intrinsic contamination of powdered infant formula and the potential for introduced contamination, and the need for safe preparation, handling and storage of prepared infant formula; 
Concerned that nutrition and health claims may be  used to promote breast-milk substitutes as 
superior to breastfeeding; 
Acknowledging that the Codex Alimentarius Commission plays a pivotal role in providing 
guidance to Member States on the proper regulation of foods, including foods for infants and young 
children; 
Bearing in mind that on several occasions the Health Assembly has called upon the Commission 
to give full consideration, with in the framework of its operational mandate, to evidence-based action 
that it might take to improve the health standards of  foods, consistent with the aims and objectives of 
relevant public health strategies, particularly WHO’s global strategy for infant and young child 
feeding (resolution WHA55.25) and Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health (resolution 
WHA57.17); 
Recognizing that such action requires a clear u nderstanding of the respective roles of the Health 
Assembly and the Codex Alimentarius Commission, and that of food regulation in the broader context of public health policies;

Report. Microbiological Risk Assessment Series No. 6, 2004, p. 37.  RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 137 
 
 
 
 
 
 Taking into account resolution WHA56.23 on the joint FAO/WHO evaluation of the work of 
the Codex Alimentarius Commission, which endorsed WHO’s increased direct involvement in the 
Commission and requested the Director-General to  strengthen WHO’s role in complementing the 
work of the Commission with other relevant WHO activities in the areas of food safety and nutrition, with special attention to issues mandated in Health Assembly resolutions, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to continue to protect, promote and support exclusive breastfeeding for six months as a 
global public-health recommendation, taking into account the findings of the WHO Expert 
Consultation on optimal duration of exclusive breastfeeding,
1 and to provide for continued 
breastfeeding up to two years of age or beyond, by implementing fully the WHO global strategy on infant and young child feeding that encourages the formulation of a comprehensive national 
policy, including where appropriate a legal framework to promote maternity leave and a 
supportive environment for six months’ exclusive breastfeeding, a detailed plan of action to 
implement, monitor and evaluate the policy, and allocation of adequate resources for this 
process; 
(2) to ensure that nutrition and health claims are not permitted for  breast-milk substitutes, 
except where specifically provided for in national legislation;
2 
(3) to ensure that clinicians and other health-care personnel, community health  workers and 
families, parents and other caregivers, particularly of infants at high risk, are provided with 
enough information and training by health -care providers , in a timely manner on the 
preparation, use and handling of powdered infant formula in order to minimize health hazards; 
are informed that powdered infant formula may contain pathogenic microorganisms and must 
be prepared and used appropriately; and, where applicable, that this information is conveyed through an explicit warning on packaging; 
(4) to ensure that financial support and other incentives  for programmes and health 
professionals working in infant and young child health do not create conflicts of interest; 
(5) to ensure that research on infant and young child feeding, which may form the basis for 
public policies, always contains a declaration relating to conflicts of interest and is subject to 
independent peer review; 
(6) to work closely with relevant entities, including manufacturers, to continue to reduce the 
concentration and prevalence of pathogens, including Enterobacter sakazakii , in powdered 
infant formula; 
(7) to continue to ensure that manufacturers a dhere to Codex Alimentarius or national food 
standards and regulations; 
(8) to ensure policy coherence at national level by stimulating collaboration between health 
authorities, food regulators and food standard-setting bodies; 
                                                     
 
1 As formulated in the conclusions and recommendations of the Expert Consultation (Geneva, 28-30 March 2001) 
that completed the systematic review of the optimal duration of exclusive breastfeeding (see document A54/INF.DOC./4) . 
2 The reference to national legislation also applies to regional economic integration organizations. 138 FIFTY-EIGHTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY 
 
   
 (9) to participate actively and constructively  in the work of the Codex Alimentarius 
Commission; 
(10) to ensure that all national agencies involved in defining national positions on public 
health issues for use in all relevant internat ional forums, including the Codex Alimentarius 
Commission, have a common and consistent underst anding of health policies adopted by the 
Health Assembly, and to promote these policies; 
2. REQUESTS the Codex Alimentarius Commission:  
(1) to continue to give full consideration, when elaborating standards, guidelines and 
recommendations, to those resolutions of the He alth Assembly that are relevant in the 
framework of its operational mandate; 
(2) to establish standards, guidelines and recommendations on foods for infants and young 
children formulated in a manner that ensures the development of safe and appropriately labelled 
products that meet their known nutritional and safety needs, thus reflecting WHO policy, in 
particular the WHO global strategy for infant and young child feeding and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and other relevant resolutions of the Health 
Assembly; 
(3) urgently to complete work currently under way on addressing the risk of microbiological 
contamination of powdered infant formula and establish appropriate microbiological criteria or standards related to E. sakazakii  and other relevant microorganisms in powdered infant formula; 
and to provide guidance on safe handling and on warning messages on product packaging; 
3. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) in collaboration with FAO, and taking into account the work undertaken by the Codex 
Alimentarius Commission,  to develop guidelines for clinicians and other health-care providers, 
community health workers and family, parents and other caregivers on the preparation, use, 
handling and storage of infant formula so as to minimize risk, and to address the particular 
needs of Member States in establishing effective measures to minimize risk in situations where 
infants cannot be, or are not, fed breast milk; 
(2) to take the lead in supporting independent ly reviewed research, including by collecting 
evidence from different parts of the world, in order to understand better the ecology, taxonomy, 
virulence and other characteristics of E. sakazakii , in line with the recommendations of the 
FAO/WHO Expert Meeting on E. sakazakii and other Microorganisms in Powdered Infant 
Formula, and to explore means of reducing its le vel in reconstituted powdered infant formula; 
(3) to provide information in order to promote and facilitate the contribution of the Codex 
Alimentarius Commission, within the framework of its operational mandate, to full 
implementation of international public-health policies; 
(4) to report to the Health Assembly each even year, along with the report on the status of 
implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and the
