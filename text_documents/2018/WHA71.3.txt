Agenda item 11.8 26 May 20 18 
Preparation for a high -level meeting of the  
General Assembly on ending tuberculosis  
The Seventy -first World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the reports on the preparation for a high -level meeting of the General 
Assembly on ending tuberculosis;1 
Noting with concern that tuberculosis remains the leading infectious disease killer in the world 
today, responsible for an estimated 1.3 million deaths and an additional 374  000 deaths among people 
living with HIV/AIDS in 2016, and that the epidemic, including drug -resistant tuberculosis, poses a 
serious threat to health security and is a priority in the response to ant imicrobial resistance;  
Reaffirming resolution WHA67.1 (2014) adopting the global strategy and targets for 
tuberculosis prevention, care and control after 2015, subsequently known as the End TB Strategy; and 
resolution WHA68.7 (2015) adopting the global act ion plan on antimicrobial resistance; as well as 
recalling the General Assembly resolution 71/3 (2016) “Political Declaration of the High -Level 
Meeting of the General Assembly on Antimicrobial Resistance”;  
Recalling the General Assembly resolution 70/1 (20 15), which adopted the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development and defined the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the associated 
target of ending the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030;  
Recalling further the report submitted to the Seventieth World Healt h Assembly in May  2017 on 
the implementation of the End TB Strategy, which concluded that global, regional and country -level 
actions as well as investments were falling far short of those needed and that high -level global support 
and regional and national commitments were required; and noting that progress is slow on all 
three  targets of the Strategy (reducing TB incidence, reducing TB mortality, and eliminating 
catastrophic costs among TB patients and their households);2 
Recognizing that to achieve the tub erculosis targets and milestones of the Sustainable 
Development Goals and of WHO’s End TB Strategy, care and prevention -related actions should be 
reinforced, paying particular attention to vulnerable groups, taking into account national contexts and 
circum stances, in the context of each country’s path towards achieving universal health coverage and 
taking into account social, economic and environmental determinants and consequences of 
tuberculosis;
