International  Health  Regulations 
The Forty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  the adoption  of the International  Health  Regulations  by the Twenty-second  World  Health 
Assembly  in 1969ï¼Œtheir  amendment  by the Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly  in 1973  with provisions 
for cholera,  and their  further  revision  by the Thirty-fourth  World  Health  Assembly  in 1981  to exclude 
smallpox  in view  of its global  eradication; 
Aware  that plague,  cholera  and yellow  fever  are designated  as diseases  subject  to the Regulations; 
Recognizing  that the purpose  of the Regulations  is to ensure  the maximum  possible  protection  against 
infection  with minimum  interference  in international  traffic; 
Recognizing  further  that the Regulations  seek  to ensure  such protection  by preventing  infection  from 
spreading  from  countries  where  it exists  or by containing  it upon  arrival; 
Noting  that there  is a continuous  evolution  in the public  health  threat  posed  by infectious  diseases 
related  to the agents  themselves,  the facilitation  of their  transmission  in changing  physical  and social 
environments  and to diagnostic  and treatment  capacities; 
Noting  that regulations  should  be based  on sound  epidemiological  and public  health  expertise; 
Concerned  about  the threat  posed  by the considerable  increases  in international  travel,  especially 
commercial  air transport,  which  may serve  to disseminate  infectious  diseases  rapidly; 
Fully aware  that the strengthening  of epidemiological  surveillance  and disease  control  activities  at 
national  level  is the main  defence  against  the international  spread  of communicable  diseases, 
1. URGES  Member  States  to participate  in revision  of the International  Health  Regulations,  contributing 
national  expertise,  experience  and suggestions; 
2. URGES  other  specialized  agencies  and organizations  of the United  Nations  system,  nongovernmental
