The Forty-fourth World Health Assembly, Noting with concern that, as at 31 December 1990: (1) the rate of collection in 1990 of current-year contributions to the effective working budget amounted to 84.40Z, leaving US$ 47 831 752 unpaid in respect of 1990 contributions (2) only 93 Members had paid their current-year contributions to the effective working budget in full, and 46 Members had made no payment towards their contributions 1. EXPRESSES concern at the level of outstanding contributions, which has had a deleterious effect on the financial situation; 2. CALLS THE ATTENTION of Members to Financial Regulation 5.6, which provides that instalments of contributions and advances shall be considered as due and payable in full by the first day of the year to which they relate, and to the importance of paying contributions as early as possible to enable the Director-General to implement the programme budget in an orderly manner 3. RECALLS that, as a result of the adoption by resolution WHA41.12 of an incentive scheme to promote the timely payment of assessed contributions, Members which paid their assessed contributions for 1989 and 1990 early in the year to which they related will have their contributions payable for the 1992-1993 programme budget reduced appreciably, while Members paying later will see their contributions payable for the 1992-1993 programme budget reduced only marginally or not at all; 4. URGES Members that are regularly late in the payment of their contributions to take urgently all steps necessary to ensure prompt and regular payment 5. REQUESTS the Director-General to draw this resolution to the attention of all Members. > ^JUJ^-^i^j^ R ES O L TON OF THE WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY RSOLUTION DE L'ASSEMBL E MONDIALE DE LA SANT RESOLUCION DE LA ASAMBLEA MUNDIAL DE LA SALUD Eleventh plenary meeting, 13 May 1991 A44 / VR / 11
