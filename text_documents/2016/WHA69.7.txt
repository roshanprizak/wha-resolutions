Having considered the report on addressing the challenges of the United Nations Decade of 
Action for Road Safety (2011−2020) : outcome of the second Global High -level  Conference on Road 
Safety – Time for Results;1 
Recognizing that road traffic injuries constitute a public health problem and a leading cause of 
death and injury around the world, with significant health and socioec onomic costs;  
Recalling resolution WHA57.10 (2004) on road safety and health, which accepted the invitation 
of the United Nations General Assembly for WHO to act as a coordinator on road safety issues within 
the United Nations system, and resolution WHA60. 22 (2007) on health systems: emergency care 
systems;   
Welcoming the proclamation of the Decade of Action for Road Safety, in United Nations 
General Assembly resolution 64/255 (2010) on improving global road safety, and the reiteration of the 
General Assemb ly’s invitation to United Nations Member States to play a leading role in 
implementing the activities of the Decade of Action in resolution 68/269 (2014);  
Commending the work of the WHO Secretariat in coordinating global road safety initiatives 
through the  United Nations Road Safety Collaboration, in providing secretariat support to the Decade 
of Action, and in leading efforts to raise awareness, increase capacity and provide technical support to 
Member States;  
Further recognizing that a multisectoral and i ntersectoral approach is needed to reduce the 
burden of road traffic deaths and injuries , and that evidence -based interventions exist; that the health 
sector has a significant role to play in improving road user behaviour, promotion of health, 
communicatio n and education regarding preventive measures, data collection and post -crash 
responses; and that a “safe system approach ” involves several other sectors for vehicle safety 
regulations, enforcement, road infrastructure, and road safety education and manage ment;

2 Reaffirming that providing basic conditions and services to address road safety is primarily a 
responsibility of governments, while recognizing nonetheless that there is a shared responsibility to 
move towards a world free from road traffic fataliti es and serious injuries, and that addressing road 
safety demands multistakeholder collaboration among the public and private sectors, academia, 
professional organizations, nongovernmental organizations and the media;  
Welcoming the large number of activiti es since 2004 that have contributed to  reducing the 
number of deaths and serious injuries due to road traffic crashes, in particular: the publication of

on road safety; the proclamation of the Decade of Action for Road Safety  2011−2020; the holding of 
three global United Nations road safety weeks; the outcome of the First Global Ministerial Conference
