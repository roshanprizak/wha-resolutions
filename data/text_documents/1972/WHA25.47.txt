WHA25.47  Standardization  of diagnostic  materials 
The Twenty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  the  importance  of the  role  of WHO  in the  standardization  of chemical  and  biological 
substances  ； 
Recognizing  also  the work  of the Organization  on reference  preparations  for laboratory  reagents  and 
on research  studies  relating  to the development  and  improvement  of laboratory  methods  ； 
Conscious  of the concern  about  the increasing  need  for standardized  reagents  for laboratory  diagnostic 
methods  in all countries  ； 
Aware  that  satisfactory  diagnostic  materials  are essential  in preventing  errors  in laboratory  test  results 
and for evaluating  and  interpreting  such  results  ； 
Noting  the rapid  proliferation  of chemical  and  biological  diagnostic  materials  and  the fact  that  there 
are few  generally  accepted  standards  or specifications  for them, 
REQUESTS  the Director-General  to study  the means  of extending  the work  of WHO  in the development 
of standards  for  chemical  and  biological  diagnostic  materials  and  related  aspects  of laboratory  methods 
and the coordination  of research  in this  field,  and  to report  thereon  to a future  Health  Assembly,  including 
an estimate  of the costs  of such  activity.
