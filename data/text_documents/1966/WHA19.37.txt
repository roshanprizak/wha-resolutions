The Nineteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Referring  to the  definition  of health  in the Constitution  as " a state  of complete  physical,  mental  and  social 
well-being  and  not  merely  the  absence  of disease  or infirmity  "; 
Noting  that  medical  progress  in the  treatment  of illness  and  injury,  while  permitting  a higher  ratio 
of survival,  results  in an increasing  number  of chronic  cases  and  permanently  disabled  persons; 
Stressing  the  role  of rehabilitation  in reducing  the  physical,  mental  and  social  consequences  of disease 
or injury;  and 
Noting  with  satisfaction  the  measures  already  taken  by the  Organization  in this  field, 
1. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to continue  collecting  information  on the  need  for  rehabilitation  services, 
on the  quality  and  quantity  of existing  rehabilitation  facilities,  on obstacles  to effective  medical  rehabilitation  and  on  the  administrative  organization  of rehabilitation  services  in the  different  Member  countries; 
2. INVITES  attention  to the  need  for  developing  rehabilitation  services  not  only  for  injuries  and  diseases 
affecting  locomotive  organs  but  also  disabling  diseases,  particularly  mental  and  cardiovascular  diseases,  and 
to the  opportunities  for  promotion  of these  services  by the  Organization; 
3. INVITES  the  attention  of Member  States  to the  importance  of developing  their  rehabilitation  services, 
as an integrant  part  of the  national  health  service; 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  when  planning  the  programme  of the  Organization  to take  into  consideration  the  need  for  intensified  training  of medical  and  paramedical  personnel  to assist  the  expansion  of rehabilitation  services;  and 
5. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to inform  the  Executive  Board  and  the  Assembly,  prior  to any  extension 
of the  activities  of the  Organization  in this  field,  what  would  be the  implications  of such  an extension  for  the 
budget  of the  Organization.
