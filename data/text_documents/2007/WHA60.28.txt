Pandemic influenza preparedness: sharing of 
influenza viruses and access to vaccines 
and other benefits 
 
The Sixtieth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on avian and pande mic influenza: developments, response and 
follow-up;1 
Reaffirming obligations of States Parties under the International Health Regulations (2005); 
Recalling resolutions WHA58.5 and WHA59.2, wh ich expressed concern about the potential of 
the H5N1 strain of Influenza-virus A  to cause a pandemic and urged Member States to disseminate to 
WHO Collaborating Centres information and releva nt biological materials, including clinical 
specimens and viruses; 
Recognizing the sovereign right of States over their biological resources, and the importance of 
collective action to mitigate public health risks; 
Recognizing that intellectual property rights do not  and should not prevent Member States from 
taking measures to protect public health; 
Recalling the Jakarta Declaration on Responsible Practices for Sharing Avian Influenza Viruses 
and Resulting Benefits and the recommendations of  the High-Level Meeting on Responsible Practices 
for Sharing Avian Influenza Viruses and R esulting Benefits (Jakarta, 26–28 March 2007); 
Recognizing, in particular, the importance of international sharing, with WHO Collaborating 
Centres, of clinical specimens and viruses as a contribution to assessment of the pandemic risk, 
development of pandemic vaccines, updating of diagnos tic reagents and test kits, and surveillance for 
resistance to antiviral medicines; 
Stressing  the need for effective and transparent intern ational mechanisms aimed at ensuring fair 
and equitable sharing of benefits, including access to, and distribution of, affordable diagnostics and 
treatments, including vaccines, to  those in need, especially in developing countries, in a timely 
manner;

2 Noting WHO’s global pandemic influenza action plan to increase vaccine supply  and its goal of 
reducing the gap between the potential vaccine demand and supply expected during an influenza 
pandemic by expanding over the medium- and long-term supply of pandemic vaccine;1 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to continue to support, strengthen and improve the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance 
Network and its procedures through  the timely sharing of viruses or  specimens with WHO 
Collaborating Centres, as a foundation of public h ealth, to ensure critical  risk assessment and 
response, and to aim to ensure and promote transp arent, fair and equitable sharing of benefits 
arising from the generation of information, diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and other technologies; 
(2) to support and promote research to improve the prevention, detection, diagnosis and 
management of influenza viral infection, with  the goal of developing better tools for public 
health; 
(3) to support WHO as appropriate in order to  identify and implement mechanisms referred 
to in paragraph 2, subparagraph (1); 
(4) to formulate as appropriate and to strength en existing policies on influenza vaccines as an 
integral part of their national influenza-pandemic preparedness plans; 
(5) to strengthen where appropriate the cap acity of national and regional regulatory 
authorities to efficiently and effectively carry out necessary measures for the rapid approval of safe and effective candidate influenza vaccines,  especially those derived from new subtypes of 
influenza viruses, and in this respect to enc ourage international collaboration among regulatory 
authorities; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to identify and propose, in close cons ultation with Member States, frameworks and 
mechanisms that aim to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits, in support of public health, 
among all Member States, taking strongly into c onsideration the specific needs of developing 
countries, such as, but not limited to: 
(a) innovative financing mechanisms to facilita te timely and afford able procurement of 
pandemic vaccines for and by Member States in need; 
(b) facilitation of acquisition by developing  countries of capacity for manufacturing incountry influenza vaccine; 
(c) access to influenza-vaccine viruses developed by WHO Collaborating Centres  for 
the production of vaccines by all influenza- vaccine manufacturers, particularly in 
developing countries;

  3  (d) in times of public health emergencies of international concern, full access of all 
influenza-vaccine manufacturers to pandemi c influenza-vaccine viruses developed by 
WHO Collaborating Centres  for the production of pandemic influenza vaccines; 
(e) technical assistance to developing countries to enhance local research and 
surveillance capacity, including staff training,  with the objective of assuring work on 
influenza viruses at national and regional levels; 
(f) upon request, provision of support to Me mber States, especially developing and 
affected countries, to improve their capacity  to establish and strengthen testing capacity 
for H5 and other influenza  viruses, including identification and characterization, and to 
establish and strengthen their capacity to meet WHO requirements for becoming a 
reference laboratory or Collaborating Centre, if desired; 
(2) to establish, in close consultation with Me mber States, an international stockpile of 
vaccines for H5N1 or other influenza viruses of  pandemic potential as appropriate, for use in 
countries in need in a timely manner and accord ing to sound public-health principles, with 
transparent rules and procedures, informed by  expert guidance and evidence, for operation, 
prioritization, release of stoc ks, management and oversight; 
(3) to formulate mechanisms and guidelines, in close consultation with Member States, 
aimed at ensuring fair and equitable distributi on of pandemic-influenza vaccines at affordable 
prices in the event of a pandemic in order to en sure timely availability of such vaccines to 
Member States in need; 
(4) to mobilize financial, technical and ot her appropriate support from Member States, 
vaccine manufacturers, development banks, char itable organizations, private donors and others, 
in order to implement mechanisms that increase th e equitable sharing of benefits as described in 
paragraph 2, subparagra phs (1), (2) and (3); 
(5) to convene an interdisciplinary working group to revise the terms of reference of WHO 
Collaborating Centres, H5 Reference Laborator ies, and national influenza centres, devise 
oversight mechanisms, formulate draft standard terms and conditions for sharing viruses 
between originating countries and WHO Collaborat ing Centres, between the latter and third 
parties, and to review all relevant documents for sharing influenza viruses and sequencing data, 
based on mutual trust, transparency , and overriding principles such as:
