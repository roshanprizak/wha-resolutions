WHA10.23 Publication  of Russian  Edition  of the  Chronicle 
The Tenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  that  the  Fifth  World  Health  Assembly  recommended  that  publication  of the  Russian 
edition  of the Chronicle  of the World  Health  Organization  be  suspended  because  of its small  distribution; 
and 
Believing  that  the  resumption  of active  participation  in the  work  of the  Organization  by certain 
countries  would  facilitate  adequate  distribution  of this  periodical, 
REQUESTS  the Director-General  to resume  publication  of the Russian  edition  of the Chronicle  as soon 
as practicable. 
Eleventh  plenary  meeting,  22  May  1957  (section  2
