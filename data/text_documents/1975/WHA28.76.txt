The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Bearing  in mind  the United  Nations  Declaration  on the Establishment  of a New  International  Economic 
Order  (United  Nations  resolution  3201  (S-VI)  as adopted  by the General  Assembly  of the United  Nations) 
in which  the  Members  of the  United  Nations  solemnly  proclaimed  their  united  determination  to work 
urgently  for the establishment  of a new  international  economic  order  which  shall  "correct  inequalities  and 
redress  existing  injustices,  make  it possible  to eliminate  the widening  gap  between  the  developed  and  the 
developing  countries  and  ensure  steadily  accelerating  economic  and  social  development  and  peace  and 
justice  for  present  and  future  generations"; 
Recalling  United  Nations  resolution  3202  (S-VI)  as adopted  by the General  Assembly  of the United 
Nations  on the Programme  of Action  on the Establishment  of a New  International  Economic  Order  which 
"complements  and  strengthens  the goals  and  objectives  embodied  in the International  Development  Strategy 
for the Second  United  Nations  Development  Decade  as well  as the new  measures  formulated  by the General 
Assembly  at its twenty-eighth  session  to offset  the shortfalls  in achieving  those  goals  and  objectives"  and 
states  that  “All  organizations,  institutions,  subsidiary  bodies  and  conferences  of the United  Nations  system 
are entrusted  with  the implementation  of the Programme  of Action"; 
Aware  of the persisting  tremendous  differences  in the  health  standards  between  the  developed  and 
developing  countries,  and  of the lack  of human,  material  and  financial  resources  of the developing  countries 
to cope  with  their  burning  health  problems  and  to build  their  national  health  services; 
Considering  that,  to meet  the goals  and  objectives  of the Second  Development  Decade  and  to implement 
the Declaration  and  the Programme  of Action  WHO  should  give  increased  priority  to the provision  of direct, 
immediate  and  adequate  assistance  and  services  to the developing  countries; 
Considering  further  that  a number  of technically  sound  requests  for assistance  could  be met  if additional 
resources  were  available  to the Organization, 
1. DECIDES  that  the regular  programme  budget  shall  ensure  A substantial  increase,  in real  terms,  of technical 
assistance  and  services  for developing  countries  from  1977  to the end  of the Second  Development  Decade  ； 
2. DECIDES  further  that  the technical  assistance  to governments  should  : 
(1) consist  primarily  of the types  of assistance  and  services  which  have  proved  to be effective  as well 
as those  now  being  developed  by the Organization; 
(2) be as flexible  as possible  and  adapted  to the specific  needs,  conditions  and  priorities  of individual 
countries  and  include  operational  components  when  necessary; 
(3) be based  on the experience  gained  and  the improved  understanding  of the constraints  limiting  the 
development  process  of the developing  countries; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to adjust  the proposed  programme  budget  for 1977  in compliance  with 
this resolution  and  to take  it into  account  in his preparation  of the 1978/1979  programme  budget  proposals; 
and 
4. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  to consider  the proposed  programme  budget  for 1977  and  the following 
years  taking  into  account  the terms  of this  resolution.
