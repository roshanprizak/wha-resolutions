The Twenty-third World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Director-General on present problems of yellow fever in West Africa and the report of the working party established to discuss these problems in detail, 1. REALIZES the gravity of the situation in 1969 when outbreaks occurred in five countries, and realizes also that there is a considerable risk of further outbreaks occurring during and after the next rainy season; 2. STRESSES that yellow fever in West Africa is A problem which is of deep concern not only to African countries but also to countries in all continents, particularly those in which potential insect vectors are present; 3. DRAWS attention to the lack of fundamental knowledge of the animal reservoirs and vectors of the virus, and of other epidemiological and epizootical aspects of the disease; 4. APPRECIATES that many of the countries at risk do not have at present sufficient resources to setup adequate vaccination programmes for the more than 16 million persons (mainly infants and children) who should be vaccinated with 17D vaccine within the next few months, or for emergency vector control operations 5. NOTES that yellow fever vaccines prepared from the 17D strain are highly effective and that A single injection will protect for at least ten years, but recognizes that further research on the thermostability of the vaccine is required 6. NOTES with satisfaction the actions undertaken by WHO in 1969 and its establishment of a mechanism for emergency action upon the occurrence of yellow fever epidemics 7. EMPHASIZES that WHO also plays A role of primary importance in establishing effective co-ordination of the programmes of the countries concerned and of contributions from outside countries and agencies; and 8. RECOMMENDS : (i) that each country in the yellow-fever endemic areas of Africa should establish a scheme for the immediate investigation of suspected cases and for rapidly informing WHO; (ii) that the health authorities of the countries in the endemic areas of Africa should, with all possible speed, and without waiting for further cases to occur, establish effective vaccination programmes in cooperation with neighbouring countries in the following order of priority: (a) immediate vaccination of presumed susceptible age-groups in districts peripheral to areas where epidemics have recently occurred; (b) vaccination of presumed susceptible age-groups in areas where ecological conditions are favourable to the spread of infection and (c) vaccination of presumed susceptible age-groups in large centres of population; (iii) that health authorities in countries in the endemic areas should plan to include yellow fever vaccination in all routine immunization programmes for newcomers by birth or immigration (iv) that countries outside the endemic areas of Africa should consider to what extent they could : (a) contribute without delay supplies, viz. vaccines, vaccination equipment and refrigerators, insecticides and equipment for their application, aswell as means of transport sufficient to meet the requirements of the immediate situation; and (b) contribute to the long-term programme referred to in sub-paragraph (viii) (V) that WHO should immediately establish in Africa a unit which, in collaboration with the authorities in the countries concerned, would ensure the collection and rapid dissemination of epidemiological information, would undertake the assessment of the probable nature and extent of the risk of spread of disease when cases first occur, would act as a centre of information on bilateral assistance, and would ensure that areas where the need is greatest should be able to obtain at any particular time the resources they require (vi) that emergency schemes for vector control setup in areas at special risk; (vii) that production laboratories be encouraged or assisted not only to increase the quantity of vaccine available, but also to improve its quality; and (viii) that a long-term internationally co-ordinated programme of research on the natural history of yellow fever in Africa should be undertaken under the auspices of WHO.
