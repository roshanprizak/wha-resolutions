g The Eighteenth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Executive Board concerning headquarters accommodation, together with the annexed reports of the Standing Committee on Headquarters Accommodation and of the Director-General 1. NOTES the increase in the architect's estimate of the total cost of the building project as a consequence of the necessary corrections in the heating and air-conditioning installation ; 2. NOTES that, notwithstanding this latest increase which brings the total estimated cost toa figure higher than the presently authorized credits and thus makes it necessary to seek additional sums, these sums can be found without great difficulty through a combination of the already planned budgetary provisions for the years 1966, 1967 and 1968, and the fact that the first repayment on the loan from the Republic and Canton of Geneva will be made only in 1969; 3. AUTHORIZES the Director-General, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of resolution WHA 16.22, to proceed with the building project inaccordance with the architect's current estimate and the plan of financing described in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee of the Executive Board;2 and 4. REQUESTS the Director-General to report further, through the Executive Board and the Standing Committee on Headquarters Accommodation, to the Nineteenth World Health Assembly on the financing of the building project.
