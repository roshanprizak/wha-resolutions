Sustaining the elimination of iodine 
deficiency disorders 
 
The Sixtieth World Health Assembly, 
Having noted with appreciation the report on sustaining the elimination of iodine deficiency 
disorders;1 
Noting that, although progress has been made by some Member States in the sustained 
elimination of iodine deficiency disorders in the past two years, between one fourth and one third of 
the world’s population still suffers from this micronutrient deficiency, most of them in impoverished 
areas of the world; 
Concerned that iodine deficiency can prevent the optimal development of children’s brains, with 
possible consequent learning impairment with subsequent social and economic consequences; 
Recognizing that the fight against iodine deficiency contributes directly to many of the 
internationally agreed health-related goals including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, 
including eradication of extreme poverty, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, 
achieving universal primary education, and promoting gender equality; 
Applauding the support of international organizations, especially WHO, UNICEF, WFP, 
bilateral development agencies and nongovernmental and private partners, including Kiwanis International, the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders and the Global 
Network for Sustained Iodine Nutrition, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to redouble their efforts to reach those people not yet protected from iodine deficiency 
disorders and to sustain successful programmes on a continuous basis; 
(2) to implement the recommendation in resolution WHA58.24 to establish multidisciplinary 
national coalitions in order to monitor the state of iodine nutrition every three years;

2 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to continue to strengthen WHO’s cooperation with other 
organizations in the United Nations system in supporting Member States in fighting iodine deficiency and report on iodine status every three years in compliance with resolution WHA58.24.
