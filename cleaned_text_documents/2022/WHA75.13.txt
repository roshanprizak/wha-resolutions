1 Including the other proposed amendments set out in the Annex to document A75/18, as well as other amendments which have or may be submitted by other States Parties to the International Health Regulations (2005) or the Director-General, including through the above-mentioned Member State-led process. 2 See Annex 18 for the financial and administrative implications for the Secretariat of this resolution. 3 Document A75/10 Rev.1. 26 SEVENTY-FIFTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY Reaffirming the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its targets, which are universal, indivisible and interlinked, and referring in particular to the following targets of the Sustainable Development Goals: 3.1 on reducing global maternal mortality, 3.2 on ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, 3.3 on ending the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combating hepatitis, waterborne diseases and other communicable diseases, and 3.8 on achieving universal health coverage, including access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all, and recognizing the important intersections between infection prevention and control and other Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all); Noting the Declaration of Alma-Ata on primary health care and the Declaration of Astana on high-quality and safe primary health care and health services and recognizing that, to achieve them, preventing harm from infection transmission at the entry point to and at all points in the health system is paramount; Recognizing the critical importance of infection prevention and control in the human and animal health sectors and that the subject is a clinical and public health discipline based on a scientific approach, providing proactive, responsive and practical preventive and control measures grounded in infectious diseases, epidemiology, social, engineering and implementation science, and health systems strengthening that requires a dedicated specialist health work force; Noting that comprehensive infection prevention and control programmes, which take the One Health approach into account, at national, subnational and facility levels are essential to produce science-based evidence and support, facilitate and/or oversee the correct, evidence-based and risk-informed implementation of infection prevention and control, as well as the resources and material support required (such as personal protective equipment); Concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent large outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have shown the devastating consequences of the lack of preparedness and substandard, insufficient and/or inadequate implementation of infection prevention and control programmes, even in high-income countries, and recognizing that they have brought infection prevention and control to the forefront; Noting that that in addition to outbreaks, WHO has estimated that hundreds of millions of patients are affected by health care-associated infections leading to deaths in one in 10 infected patients every year, and noting further that in acute-care hospitals, of every 100 patients, seven in high-income countries and 15 in low- and middle-income countries will acquire at least one health care-associated infection during their hospital stay, and that up to 30% of patients in intensive care are affected by health care-associated infections, with an incidence that is two to 20 times higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries; Recognizing that one quarter of health care facilities lacked basic water services in 2019, exposing 1.8 billion people, including health care workers and patients, to greater risk of infection, highlighting the major gaps in water, sanitation and hygiene services in health care facilities, which play a critical role in infection prevention and control, and noting the modest costs for achieving minimal water, sanitation and hygiene safety, which range from US$ 6.5 billion to US$ 9.6 billion in the 46 least developed countries, which represent 46% of these countries recurrent health spending; Noting that the added costs of health care-associated infections, which may vary from US$ 1000 to US$ 12 000 on average per episode depending on the country, result in a significant economic burden on health systems and out-of-pocket expenses for patients and families; and that the mortality among RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 27 patients affected by health care-associated sepsis was 24.4%, increasing up to 52.3% among patients treated in an intensive care unit and at least two to three times higher among those infected with antimicrobial-resistant organisms, in neonates and in low- and middle-income countries; Noting also that most antibiotic-resistant infections are acquired in health care facilities, 75% of disability-adjusted life years attributable to antimicrobial resistance are due to health care-associated infections. Each year, antimicrobial resistance costs health care systems around US$ 1.2 billion. For example, up to 75% of prescriptions for antimicrobial medicines in long-term care facilities are inappropriate, yet policies to tackle inappropriate antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance, such as antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention and control, remain underused or suboptimal; Noting further that a recent systematic analysis and predictive statistical models by antimicrobial resistance researchers showed that in 2019 the estimated number of deaths associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance was 4.95 million globally, including 1.27 million deaths attributable to bacterial antimicrobial resistance and reflect the burden of antimicrobial resistance as a leading cause of death globally, with a high impact in low-resource settings; Observing that most cost-effective interventions to limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance in health care are those aimed at improving all drivers of health care-associated infections, including hygiene and antimicrobial stewardship, with the potential to prevent three of four attributable deaths; Noting that public health emergencies have demonstrated that infection prevention and control, together with core capacities required by the International Health Regulations (2005), plays a critical role in preventing and responding timely and effectively to public health risks and emergencies of national and international concern; Recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic has also demonstrated the critical role of health system resiliency in providing essential health services and maintaining functional health systems and that the cornerstone of health system resiliency is keeping health care workers, patients and visitors safe through a series of measures, including infection prevention and control, best practices and maintaining essential infrastructure, including transmission-based precautions and water, sanitation and waste management wherever health care is provided; Recognizing the unique opportunity to harness the experience of the heightened global awareness of infection prevention and control and investments made during the COVID-19 pandemic for sustained improvements in infection prevention and control, 1.
