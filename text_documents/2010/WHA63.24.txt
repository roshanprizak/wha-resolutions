Agenda item 11.23 21 May 2010 
Accelerated progress towards achievement of 
Millennium Development Goal 4 to reduce child 
mortality: prevention and treatment of pneumonia 
 
The Sixty-third World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on treatment and prevention of pneumonia;1 
Aware of the joint WHO/UNICEF report on a global action plan for the prevention and control 
of pneumonia, presented in November 2009;2 
Noting the first advance market commitment  on the pneumococcal vaccine and the progress 
made so far in integrating the Haemophilus influenzae  type b vaccine into routine immunization 
programmes; 
Noting also the introduction of the pneumococc al Accelerated Develo pment and Introduction 
Plans; 
Recalling that resolution WHA58.15 on global im munization strategy requested the DirectorGeneral to mobilize resources to promote the availa bility and affordability in countries of future new 
vaccines based on evidence of epidemiological profiles; 
Concerned at the lack of substantial progress towards reducing morbidity and mortality from 
pneumonia, despite it being globally the leading cause of mortality of children under the age of five 
years; 
Mindful that decreasing the global burden of pneumonia will be essential for reaching 
Target 4.A of Millennium Development Goal 4; 
Noting that safe and highly effective tools are available for pneumonia control in the form of 
WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illn ess approach for case management at all levels, 
universal childhood immunization against Haemophilus influenzae  type b and Streptococcus 
pneumoniae  infections, improvement of nutrition and low birth weight, control of indoor air pollution

2 arising from household use of solid fuels and se cond-hand smoking in households, and prevention and 
management of HIV infection; 
Further noting that affordable price of vaccine s in preventing pneumonia and significant scaling 
up of cold-chain capacities determine the adoptio n and implementation of vaccination programmes 
particularly in developing countries; 
Concerned that pneumonia continues to cause mo re than 1.8 million preventable deaths in 
children less than five years of age globally each year; 
Noting that the GAVI Alliance and other donors have  made substantial resources available, and 
that the International Finance Facility for Immunisation and the PAHO revolving fund for 
immunization provide powerful mechanisms for di recting resources to immunization programmes; 
Welcoming the contribution to the mobilizati on of resources for development of voluntary 
innovative financing initiatives taken by groups of Member States; 
Noting in addition that efforts to strengthen the cap acity of health systems to detect and manage 
pneumonia effectively are likely also to contri bute positively to efforts to achieve Millennium 
Development Goal 5 (Improve maternal health); 
Aware that pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 has raised awareness of the need for systemwide strengthening of management of serious acute r espiratory infections, and noting that the time is 
therefore opportune to build upon investments made related to the pandemic and to continue efforts to 
ensure that patients with acute respiratory inf ections receive prompt and effective treatment, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to apply, according to their specific c ontexts, the policies, strategies and tools 
recommended by WHO to prevent and treat pneumonia; 
(2) to establish evidence-based national polic ies and operational plans for strengthening 
health systems in order to expand coverage of populations at risk with effective preventive and 
curative interventions; 
(3) to assess programme performance including the coverage and impact of interventions in 
an effective and timely manner, and use this assessment to inform WHO’s country-profile 
database; 
(4) to identify national and international resources, both human and financial, for 
strengthening health systems and for the provision of technical support in order to ensure that 
the most locally and epidemiologically appropr iate strategies are im plemented and target 
populations reached; 
(5) to implement the recommendations in the joint WHO/UNICEF global action plan for the 
prevention and control of pneumonia, noting the importance of: 
(a) integrated case management at community, health-centre and hospital levels;   WHA63.24 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  (b) immunization by accelerating the adop tion of affordable and cost-effective 
vaccines based on evidence of national epidemiological profiles; 
(c) exclusive breastfeeding for six months; 
(d) improvement of nutrition and prevention of low birth weight; 
(e) control of indoor air pollution, and; (f) prevention and management of HIV infection; 
(6) to encourage integrated approaches to  pneumonia prevention and treatment through 
multisectoral collaboration and community  responsibility and participation; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to strengthen human resources for preventi on and control of pneumonia at all levels, 
especially the country level, thereby improving the capacity of WHO’s country offices to 
provide support to national health programme s for coordinating the work of partners on 
preventing and controlling pneumonia; 
(2) to bring together interested Member Stat es, organizations in the United Nations system, 
the GAVI Alliance, medical research councils, and other interested stakeholders in a forum in 
order to improve coordination between different stakeholders in the fight against pneumonia 
and mobilize resources to promote the availability and affordability  of Haemophilus influenzae 
type b and pneumococcal vaccines; 
(3) to expand the coverage of the report to th e Health Assembly through the Executive Board 
on the status of progress made in achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals, 
requested in resolution WHA61.18, to include progress on the implementation of this resolution, starting from the Sixty-fourth World Health Assembly.
