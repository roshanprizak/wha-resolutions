Global public health response to natural occurrence, 
accidental release or deliberate use of biological 
and chemical agents or radionuclear material 
that affect health 
 
The Fifty-fifth World Health Assembly, 
Underlining that the World Health Organi zation focuses on the possible public health 
consequences of an incident involving biological  and chemical agents and radionuclear material, 
regardless of whether it is characterized as a natura l occurrence, accidental release or a deliberate act; 
Having reviewed the report on the deliberate use of biological and chemical agents to cause 
harm: public health response;1 
Seriously concerned about threats against civilia n populations, including those caused by natural 
occurrence or accidental release of biological or chem ical agents or radionuclear material as well as 
their deliberate use to cause illness and death in target populations; 
Noting that such agents can be disseminated through a range of mech anisms, including the 
food- and water-supply chains, thereby threatening the integrity of public health systems; 
Acknowledging that natural occurrence or accidental  release of biological, chemical agents and 
radionuclear material could have serious global publ ic health implications and jeopardise the public 
health achievements of the past decades; 
Acknowledging also that the local release of biol ogical, chemical and radionuclear material 
designed to cause harm could have serious global pub lic health implications and jeopardize the public 
health achievements of the past decades; 
Recalling resolution WHA54.14 on global health security: epidemic alert and response, which 
stresses the need for all Member St ates to work together, with WHO and with other technical partners, 
in addressing health emergencies of internati onal concern, and resolution WHA45.32 on the 
International Programme on Chemical Safety, whic h emphasized the need to establish or strengthen 
national and local capacities to respond to chemical incidents;

2 Recognizing that one of the most effective met hods of preparing for deliberately caused disease 
is to strengthen public health surveillance and response activities for naturally or accidentally 
occurring diseases, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to ensure they have in place national di sease-surveillance plans which are complementary 
to regional and global disease-surveillance mechanis ms, and to collaborate in the rapid analysis 
and sharing of surveillance data of international humanitarian concern; 
(2) to collaborate and provide mutual support in  order to enhance national capacity in field 
epidemiology, laboratory diagnoses,  toxicology and case management; 
(3) to treat any deliberate use, including local, of biological and chemical agents and 
radionuclear attack to cause harm also as a globa l public health threat, and to respond to such a 
threat in other countries by sharing expertise, supplies and resources in order rapidly to contain 
the event and mitigate its effects; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to continue, in consultation with rele vant intergovernmental agencies and other 
international organizations, to strengthen globa l surveillance of infectious diseases, water 
quality, and food safety, and related activities su ch as revision of the International Health 
Regulations and development of WHO’s food saf ety strategy, by coordinating information 
gathering on potential health risks and disease out breaks, data verification, analysis and 
dissemination, by providing support to la boratory networks, and by making a strong 
contribution to any international humanitarian response, as required; 
(2) to provide tools and support for Member St ates, particularly developing countries, in 
strengthening their national health systems, notab ly with regard to emergency preparedness and 
response plans, including disease surveillance and toxicology, risk communication, and 
psychosocial consequences of emergencies; 
(3) to continue to issue international gui dance and technical information on recommended 
public health measures to deal with the deliberate use of biological and chemical agents to cause 
harm, and to make this informa tion available on WHO’s web site; 
(4) to examine the possible development of new tools, within the mandate of WHO, 
including modelling of possible scenarios of natural occurrence, accidental release or deliberate use of biological, chemical agents and radionucl ear material that affect health, and collective 
mechanisms concerning the global public health re sponse to contain or mitigate the effects of 
natural occurrence, accidental release or deliber ate use of biological, chemical agents and 
radionuclear material that affect health.
