WHA14.2  Development  of the Malaria  Eradication  Programme 
The Fourteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on the development  of the malaria  eradication 
programme  ; 
Noting  that  the  results  of pilot  projects  in Africa  have  shown  the  technical  feasibility  of obtaining 
interruption  of transmission  in those  areas  of this  continent  where  total  coverage  can  be assured; 
Noting  with  satisfaction  the strengthening  of epidemiological  assessment  activities  on national  and 
international  level,  while  recognizing  the continuing  need  to overcome  some  practical  problems  in these 
operations; 
Noting  that  a new  stage  of the malaria  eradication  programme,  called  " pre-eradication  programme  ", 
has been  established  by the Organization  for  countries  whose  administrative  and  health  services  are not 
yet sufficiently  developed  to launch  an eradication  programme; 
Noting  that  an official  register  to record  areas  where  malaria  eradication  has  been  achieved  has  been 
established  by the  Director-General  and  that  steps  have  been  taken  by the  Organization  to implement 
the task  of inspection  and  certification  for registering  such  areas  ; and 
Recognizing  that  in a number  of projects  progress  continues  to be impeded  through  administrative 
and operational  deficiencies, 
1. NOTES  with  satisfaction  the general  progress  made  in the world-wide  campaign  of malaria  eradication  ; 
2. URGES  governments 
(1) to  effect  further  improvement  in methods  of epidemiological  assessment  and  surveillance,  making 
maximum  use  of the collaboration  of existing  general  medical  rural  facilities;  and 
(2) to  give  full  administrative  and  financial  support  to their  eradication  campaigns  so as to ensure 
thoroughness  and  efficiency  of application;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to report  on future  progress  of the malaria  eradication  programme 
to the  Fifteenth  World  Health  Assembly.
