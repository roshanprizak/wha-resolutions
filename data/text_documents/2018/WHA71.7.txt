Agenda item 12.4 26 May 20 18 
Digital health  
The Seventy -first World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on mHealth;1 
Recalling resolutions WHA58.28 (2005) on eHealth and WHA66.24 (2013) on eHealth 
standardization and interoperability;  
Recognizing the potential of digital technologies to advance the Sustainable Development 
Goals, and in particular to support health systems in all c ountries in health promotion and disease 
prevention, and by improving the accessibility, quality and affordability of health services;  
Recognizing also that while technology and innovations can enhance health service capabilities, 
human interaction remains  a key element to patients’ well -being;  
Underscoring the need to ensure that digital health solutions complement and enhance existing 
health service delivery models, strengthen integrated, people -centred health services and contribute to 
improved populatio n health, and health equity, including gender equality, and addressing the lack of 
evidence on the impact of digital health in these respects;  
Acknowledging that the transfer of technology and knowledge on mutually agreed terms, as 
well as technical cooper ation, aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Strengthen the means 
of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development), are important in 
promoting digital health;  
Highlighting recent progress in the development and implementation of digital health strategies, 
policies, legislation and programmes by Member States,2 WHO and partner organizations;  
Acknowledging previous experience3 of countries and organizations, the interconnectedness of 
digital technologies, the colle ction, management and evaluation of health data, the robustness of the 
enabling environment, in line with established good practices, while considering the sustainability of 
innovations, and their feasibility, scale -up and inclusivity,

2 1. URGES Member States:1 
(1) to assess their use of digital technologies for health, including in health information 
systems at the national and subnational levels, in order to identify areas of improvement, and to 
prioritize, as appropriate, the development, evaluation, implementatio n, scale -up and greater 
utilization of digital technologies, as a means of promoting equitable, affordable and universal 
access to health for all, including the special needs of groups that are vulnerable in the context 
of digital health;  
(2) to consider,  as appropriate, how digital technologies could be integrated into existing 
health systems infrastructures and regulation, to reinforce national and global health priorities 
by optimizing existing platforms and services, for the promotion of people -centere d health and 
disease prevention and in order to reduce the burden on health systems;  
(3) to optimize, in health systems development and reforms, the use of resources by 
developing health services alongside the application and use of digital technologies;  
(4) to identify priority areas where normative guidance and technical assistance and advice 
on digital health would be beneficial, including, but not limited to, gaps in research, evidence based standards, support to implementation and scale -up, financing a nd business models, 
content, evaluation, cost –effectiveness and sustainability, data security, ethical and legal issues, 
re-use and adaptation of existing digital health and other relevant tools;  
(5) to work towards and support interoperability of digital  technologies for health by, inter  
alia, promoting the use of international and open standards as an affordable, effective and easily 
adaptable solution;  
(6) to disseminate, as appropriate, best practices and successful examples of digital health 
architect ure, programmes, and services, in particular effective policy design and practical 
implementation, with the international community, including through WHO, bilateral, regional, 
cross -regional and global networks, digital platforms and hubs;  
(7) to strengt hen public health resilience and promote opportunities, as appropriate, through 
the use of digital technologies, including to improve access to, and monitoring, sharing and use 
of, quality data, direct citizen, health worker and government engagement, and to build capacity 
for rapid response to disease incidents and public health emergencies, leveraging the potential of 
digital information and communication technology to enable multidirectional communications, 
feedback loops and data -driven “adaptive manage ment”;  
(8) to build, especially through digital means, capacity for human resources for digital health, 
as appropriate, across both health and technology sectors, and to communicate areas of specific 
need to WHO in order to receive appropriate technical as sistance;  
(9) to improve the digital skills of all citizens, including through working with civil society to 
build public trust and support for digital health solutions, and to promote the application of 
digital health technology in the provision of, and access to, everyday health services;  
                                                      
1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations.    WHA 71.7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  3 (10) to develop, as appropriate, legislation and/or data protection policies around issues such 
as data access, sharing, consent, security, privacy, interoperability and inclusivity consistent 
with international human r ights obligations and to communicate these on a voluntary basis to 
WHO;  
(11) to develop, as appropriate, and in coordination with existing and emerging regional hubs 
and support mechanisms, effective partnerships with stakeholders from across all sectors i n the
