Agenda item 15.4 24 May 20 14 
Access to essential medicines  
 
The Sixty -seventh World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on access to essential medicines;1 
Noting that WHO ’s definition of an essential medicine2 contains the following elements: 
“Essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority health care needs of the population ” and 
“Essential medicines are selected with  due regard to their public health relevance, evidence of efficacy 
and safety, and comparative cost –effectiveness ”; 
Recalling resolution WHA28.66 on prophylactic and therapeutic substances that relates to the 
formulation and implementation of medicines pol icies and pharmaceutical strategies; the Declaration 
of Alma -Ata in 1978 that recognized the provision of essential medicines as one of the pillars of 
primary health care, and subsequent resolutions in relation to essential medicines, such as resolution 
WHA54.11 on the WHO medicines strategy, WHA58.27 on improving the containment of 
antimicrobial resistance, WHA60.16 on progress in the rational use of medicines, WHA60.20 on 
better medicines for children, WHA60.29 on health technologies, WHA61.21 on the glob al strategy 
and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property, and WHA64.9 on sustainable 
health financing structures and universal coverage, as well as WHA66.10 in which the Health 
Assembly endorsed the WHO global action plan for t he prevention and control of noncommunicable 
diseases 2013 –2020, and which includes Target (9) on the availability of essential medicines required 
to treat noncommunicable diseases;  
Bearing in mind that the WHO medicines strategy, as set out in the Twelfth  General Programme 
of Work 2014 –2019, is based on the principles of evidence -based selection of a limited range of 
medicines, efficient procurement and distribution systems, affordable prices, and the rational use of 
medicines in order to promote better ma nagement and greater avail ability of medicines, more 
cost-effective use of health resources, and higher quality health care;  
Considering that the effective implementation of the above principles is of critical importance to 
improving people ’s health, progr essing towards universal health coverage and achieving the health -related  
Millennium Development Goals;  
Welcoming WHO ’s regional actions in support of greater access to – and availability, 
affordability and rational use of – safe, effective and quality -assured essential medicines, including

2 development of the Regional Office for the Western Pacific Regional Framework for Action on 
Access to Essential Medicines (2011 –2016);  
Acknowledging the complexity of the medicines supply chain and the challenges that co untries 
encounter in this regard, the importance of good governance for medicines programmes,1 and the 
consequences of the high costs of medicines, which are among the factors that make accessing care 
and treatment unaffordable;  
Aware that shortages of ess ential medicines are a global problem that has an impact on the care 
of patients, the causes and implications of which vary from one country to another, and that there is 
insufficient information to determine the magnitude and specific characteristics of t he problem;  
Realizing the role of evidence -based clinical treatment guidelines to guide cost -effective 
treatment practices, the need for reliable and unbiased information to support rational prescribing, and 
the importance of increased health literacy to s upport patients and consumers to use medicines wisely;  
Noting with concern that despite sustained efforts over a number of decades by Member States, 
the Secretariat and partners, most low -income countries are still facing a multitude of challenges in 
impro ving the availability, affordability and rational use of essential medicines;  
Noting that the goal of Member States is to increase access to affordable, safe, effective and 
quality -assured essential medicines, including as appropriate, through the full use  of the flexibilities in 
the Agreement on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights in line with the Global 
Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health Innovation and Intellectual Property;  
Noting that support for research and development is i mportant for the sustainable supply of 
future essential medicines, to address public health needs,  
1. URGES Member States:2

essential medicines, in order to improve their availability, affordability, quality and rational use;  
(2) to improve national policies for selectio n of essential medicines that should include

country’s health needs and priorities;  
(3) to encourage and support research on health systems regarding the procurement, supply 
and rational use of essential medicines;  
                                                   
1 In WHO’s assessment instrument for measuring transparency in the public pharmaceutical sector  (document 
WHO/EMP/MAR/2009.4), “good governance ” refers to the formulation and implementation of appropriate policies and 
procedures that ensure the eff ective, efficient and ethical management of pharmaceutical systems, in particular medicines 
regulatory systems and medicine supply systems, in a manner that is transparent, accountable, follows the rule of law and 
minimizes corruption.
