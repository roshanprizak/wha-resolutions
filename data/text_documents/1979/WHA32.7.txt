ASSESSMENT OF VIET NAM
The Thirty-second World Health Assembly,
Recalling that the Thirtieth World Health Assembly, in resolution WHA30.13, fixed a 
provisional assessment for Viet Nam, to be adjusted to the definitive assessment rate when 
established;
Noting that the United Nations General Assembly, in resolution ЗЗ/ll, established the 
assessment of Viet Nam at the rates of one-half of 0.02% for the second half of 1976 and 
0.03% for 1977 and for 1978 and 1979;
Recalling the principle, established in resolution WHA8.5, and confirmed in resolution 
WHA24.12, that the latest available United Nations scale of assessment should be used as a 
basis for determining the scale of assessment to be used by WHO;
Recalling further that the Twenty-sixth World Health Assembly, in resolution WHA26.21, 
affirmed its belief that the scale of assessment in WHO should follow as closely as possible 
that of the United Nations;
DECIDES
(1) that Viet Nam shall be assessed at the rate of one-half of 0.02% for 1976 from
1 July 1976 onwards;
(2) that Viet Nam shall be assessed at the rate of 0.03% for 1977 and future years.
