Having  considered  the  organizational  study  prepared  by the Executive  Board  on the  planning  for and 
impact  of extrabudgetary  resources  on WHO's  programmes  and  policy,1 
1. AGREES  that  the study  has  far-reaching  implications  for furthering  the work  of the Organization  and  that 
it constitutes  a suitable  basis  for the fulfilment  of WHO's  constitutional  mandate  as the  directing  and  coordinating  authority  on international  health  work; 
2. NOTES  with  appreciation  the  contributions  already  obtained  by or pledged  to the Organization  and  to 
developing  countries  for activities  in the health  field; 
3. URGES  that  all existing  and  potential  sources  of extrabudgetary  funds  should  provide  the  Organization 
with  increased  support  for the expansion  of its efforts  in the health  field; 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General,  within  the established  policies  of the Organization  : 
(1) to  take  particularly  into  account  the  promotion  of those  planned  health  programmes  that  could 
attract  additional  resources  for the benefit  of the developing  countries; 
(2) to  continue  to develop  appropriate  mechanisms  for  attracting  and  coordinating  an increased 
volume  of bilateral  and  multilateral  aid for health  purposes; 
(3) to  continue  his efforts  on an interagency  basis  to harmonize  programme  budget  cycles  and  planning 
and operational  procedures  of the  major  United  Nations  funding  agencies  with  those  applied  to the 
regular  programmes  of the organizations  in the United  Nations  system.
