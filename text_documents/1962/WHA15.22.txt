WHA15.22 Continued  Assistance  to Newly  Independent  States 
The Fifteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  studied  the report  of the Director-General  on continued  assistance  to newly  independent  States,4 
including  the programme  for assisting  such  States  in developing  national  health  plans  and  in accelerating 
the education  and  training  of their  national  staff,  and the possible  provision  of operational  assistance  to such 
States; 
Taking  into  account  the discussion  of the Executive  Board  at its twenty-ninth  session  on this  subject;5 
Cognizant  of the urgent  need  to develop  the health  services  of newly  independent  States  which  are of 
such  significance  for the health  of their  people  and  for their  socio-economic  progress; 
Realizing  further  that  such  development  cannot  be effective  unless  it is integrated  with  the  overall 
development  programme  of these  States, 
1. NOTES  with  satisfaction  the assistance  being  provided  by WHO  in developing  the health  programmes 
of newly  independent  States  and  the emphasis  placed  in the proposed  programme  on national  health  planning 
and on education  and  training  of national  staff; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to continue  to report  to the World  Health  Assembly  and  the Executive 
Board  on assistance  to newly  independent  States; 
3. DECIDES  that  assistance  to these  countries  should  be accelerated  along  the lines  recommended  by the 
Director-General  in his report  and,  for this  purpose,  approves  the  following  programme  provisions  and 
financial  arrangements  : 
I. PROGRAMME  PROVISIONS 
4. AUTHORIZES  the  Director-General  to implement  an accelerated  programme  for  assisting  newly  independent  and  emerging  States,  particularly  in Africa,  concentrating  on : 
(a) national  health  planning  and  related  training; 
(b) expanding  and  accelerating  medical  education  and  training  of national  staff; 
(c) providing  operational  assistance  in accordance  with  the principles  set forth  in paragraph  6 below; 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to study  the question  of WHO's  serving  as a co-ordinator  in the provision 
of assistance  to newly  independent  States  with  a view  primarily  to assisting  them  in the basic  training  and 
higher  education  of their  national  medical  staff; 
6. DECIDES  that  the principles  under  which  WHO  may  provide  operational  assistance  shall  be as follows  : 
(a) that  the role  of WHO  be one of filling  gaps  in the maintenance  of a minimum  skeleton  staff  essential 
for tiding  over  a critical  situation  in the development  of a basic  health  service  and  of raising  the health 
services  of countries  where  the services  are below  standard.  Special  emphasis  should  be put  on the 
possibilities  of combining  this  with  the efforts  to train  medical  and  auxiliary  personnel  at all levels; 
(b) that  the Organization  be satisfied  that  the countries  are making  every  effort  to achieve  self-sufficiency 
in the shortest  possible  time  in meeting  the costs  of essential  medical  and  paramedical  staff  from  their 
own resources; 
(c) that  such  operational  staff  shall  be placed  at the disposal  of governments  concerned  and  shall 
carry  out  their  assigned  duties  under  the administrative  control  of the government  concerned; 
(id) the  responsibility  for defraying  the costs  of such  staff  shall  be established  by special  agreements 
between  WHO  and  each  recipient  government,  it being  understood  that  the financial  participation  of 
the government  may,  where  necessary,  be limited  to an agreed  contribution; 
(e) that  WHO  operational  assistance  be provided  either  (i) by recruiting  staff  in co-operation  with 
the government  concerned  or (ii) by a system  of grants-in-aid  for the purpose  of meeting  the urgent 
needs  of operational  staff,  each  grant-in-aid  to be governed  by the terms  of an agreement  between  WHO 
and the recipient  government  under  which  WHO  would  retain  adequate  control  commensurable  with 
its financial  investment. 
II. FINANCIAL  ARRANGEMENTS 
Recognizing  that  the current  legislation  governing  the United  Nations  Special  Fund  and  the Expanded 
Programme  of Technical  Assistance  does  not make  it possible  for operational  staff  to be financed  from  those 
sources  of funds; 
Recognizing  further  that  the  resources  at present  available  to the  Expanded  Programme  and  the 
Special  Fund  are limited; 
Recognizing  also  that  financing  by the Organization  of operational  staff  as described  in paragraph  6 
above,  even  on a limited  scale,  is not  feasible  without  substantial  aid  from  additional  sources, 
7. APPEALS  to the General  Assembly  of the United  Nations  to arrange  that  the Expanded  Programme,  the 
Special  Fund  and  OPEX  be given  sufficient  resources,  with  such  alteration  in legislation  as may  be appropriate, 
so that  they  can  be adequate  to finance  the  health  needs  defined  in part  I above;  and  further,  pending  the 
time  when  resources  are  available  in the Special  Fund,  OPEX  and  in the  Expanded  Programme; 
8. AUTHORIZES  the establishment  of a Special  Account  for Accelerated  Assistance  to Newly  Independent 
and Emerging  States,  to be part  of the Voluntary  Fund  for Health  Promotion  and  to be governed  by the 
provisions  of resolution  WHA13.24; 
9. DECIDES  further  that  the  programmes  defined  under  part  I of this  resolution  may  be financed  from 
any source  of funds  available  to the Organization,  provided  that  the costs  in 1963,  under  the regular  budget, 
for operational  staff  as described  in paragraph  6 above  shall  not  exceed  $700  000;  and 
10. REQUESTS  the Director-General  and  the Executive  Board  to continue  to study  methods  and  forms  of 
providing  effective  assistance  to newly  independent  States  and,  in particular,  to review  the financial  aspects 
of the provision  of such  assistance,  bearing  in mind  the criteria  set forth  in part  I of this  resolution; 
11. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to bring  this  resolution  together  with  his report  to the  attention  of 
Members  and  Associate  Members.
