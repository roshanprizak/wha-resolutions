Noncommunicable disease
prevention and control
The Fifty-first World Health Assembly,
Having considered the report by the Director-General on noncommunicable disease prevention and control;Recalling The world health report 1997 , which describes the high rates of mortality, morbidity and
disability from major noncommunicable diseases, which account for nearly half of all deaths, a considerable
proportion of them premature;
Noting that noncommunicable diseases already represent a significant burden on the public health services
of Member States and that the problem is growing;
Alarmed by the rising trend and the bleak forecast for the twenty-first century as a consequence of the
demographic and epidemiological transition, and the globalization of economic processes;
Recognizing that they cause enormous human suffering and threaten the ec onomies of Member States,
where costly treatment will further deprive the poor and powerless and increase the inequ ities in health between
population groups and countries;
Mindful of common major behavioural and environmental risk factors that are more amenable to
modification through the implementation of concerted essential public health action, as has been demonstratedrecently in several Member States;
Aware that, as resources diminish, health professionals, particularly those in the forefront of health care
delivery, often become the major source of health information as well as the providers of care and support toindividuals and communities;
Recognizing the importance of, and continued need for, broad international action and cooperation in the
development and promotion of policies and strategies to assist Member States in meeting the growing challengeof chronic noncommunicable diseases in the most cost-effective way,
1. ENDORSES the proposed framework for the integrated prevention and control of noncommunicable
diseases, including the support of healthy lifestyles, the provision of public health services and the majorinvolvement of health, nutr ition and other relevant professions in improving the lifestyles and health of
individuals and communities;WHA51.18
22. URGES Member States to collaborate with WHO in developing a global strategy for the prevention and
control of noncommunicable diseases based on best practices and operational research, as part of their healthsector reforms, in order:
(a) to promote health and reduce major common risk factors for chronic noncommunicable diseases
through essential public health action and the integration of preventive measures within the functions ofhealth services, and particularly in primary health care;
(b) to collate information and set standards in order to ensure appropriate case detection and
management;
(c) to monitor scientific data and support research in a broad spectrum of related areas, including human
genetics, nutrition and diet, matters of particular concern to women, and development of human resourcesfor health;
(d) to exert a concerted effort against the use of tobacco, throughout the world and especially in order
to protect the worldâ€™s young people;
3. REQUESTS the Director-General:
(1) to develop a global strategy for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases within the
framework of the renewed WHO health-for-all policy for the twenty-first century and, in consultation withMember States and the agencies and professional organizations concerned, to give priority to such activitiesto help Member States develop corresponding national policies and programmes;
(2) to ensure, while developing the strategy, an effective managerial mechanism for collaboration and
technical support involving all programmes concerned at different levels of the Organization, as well asWHO collaborating centres, emphasizing the development and strengthening of global and regionaldemonstration projects;
(3) to solicit the support of nongovernmental organizations and other international agencies by creating
a forum for the exchange of experience and results of research;
(4) to encourage cooperation with the private sector, within the current guidelines of WHO, so as to
mobilize extrabudgetary resources for the implementation of plans at the global and interregional level andto promote capacity-building at the national level;
(5) to submit the proposed global strategy and a plan, with a timetable for its implementation, to the
Executive Board and the Health Assembly in 1999.
