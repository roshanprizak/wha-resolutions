FORTY-SIXTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA46.31 
Agenda  item  18.2  14  May  1993 
DENGUE  PREVENTION  AND  CONTROL 
The Forty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  CD31.R26  and  CD33.R19  of the  Directing  Council  of the  Pan  American  Health 
Organization  on vectors  of dengue; 
Aware  that  epidemic  dengue  continues  to pose  a problem,  with  dramatic  increases  in cases  and  extreme 
risk of rapid  and  serious  outbreaks,  and  that  dengue  haemorrhagic  fever  and  dengue  shock  syndrome  are 
spreading  with  associated  loss  of life,  hampering  socioeconomic  development,  affecting  hospital  services, 
tourism  and  employment  (through  loss  of days  of work),  and  threatening  the  lives  of children  as well  as the 
health  and  well-being  of adults  in a large  proportion  of the  urban,  peri-urban  and  some  rural  populations  of 
tropical  regions; 
Deeply  concerned  at the  increasingly  frequent  occurrence  of new  epidemics  and  the  rising  fatality  rates 
in the  Americas  and  Asia,  the  rapid  spread  of dengue  mosquito  vectors,  Aedes  aegypti  and  Aedes  albopictus, 
and their  continued  proliferation,  constituting  a serious  health  hazard  as a cause  not  only  of epidemic  dengue 
but also  of other  serious  diseases  such  as yellow  fever,  chikungunya  and  epidemic  polyarthritis  of which  they 
are the  vectors; 
Recognizing  that  epidemics  of dengue  and  dengue  haemorrhagic  fever  are  predominantly  confined  to 
cities,  although  significant  outbreaks  have  occurred  in rural  areas  also,  and  that  population  movements  and 
unplanned  rapid  urbanization,  particularly  where  water  supply  is poor,  will  continue  to increase  the  risk  of 
dengue  transmission; 
Recognizing  that  although  there  are  positive  developments  in dengue  vaccine  research,  including  the 
successful  completion  of formal  Phase  I and  II clinical  trials  using  a live，attenuated,  tetravalent  candidate 
vaccine,  and  acknowledging  that  while  manufacturing  for Phase  III efficacy  testing  is proceeding,  a vaccine 
however  is not yet available  for public  health  use; 
Appreciating  the  fundamental  importance  of community  participation  in most  control  measures,  such  as 
those  to prevent  breeding  of A. aegypti; 
Aware  that  a major  problem  in controlling  vector-borne  diseases,  including  dengue,  is the  lack  of 
specialists  capable  of planning  and  implementing  such  disease  control  programmes  in many  countries  and 
carrying  out  the  necessary  operational  research; 
Acknowledging  that  governments  in countries  where  dengue,  dengue  haemorrhagic  fever  and  dengue 
shock  syndrome  are  endemic  are  having  great  difficulty  in organizing,  staffing  and  financing  nationwide  dengue 
control  programmes; 
Recognizing  that  control  efforts  will  require  the  joint  efforts  of high-level  policy  and  decision-makers  with 
health  authorities，municipal  planners  and  those  responsible  for public  health, 
WHA46.26

1. CONFIRMS  that dengue  prevention  and control  should  be among  the priorities  of WHO; 
2. URGES  Member  States: 
(1) to strengthen  national  and local  programmes  for the prevention  and control  of dengue,  dengue 
haemorrhagic  fever  and dengue  shock  syndrome,  ensuring  monitoring  and assessment  by general  health 
services  and other  institutions  as appropriate  and reinforcing  surveillance  of the vector  population, 
prevalence  of the virus  and numbers  of cases  in urban  areas  and among  high-risk  populations  such  as the 
urban  and peri-urban  poor; 
(2) to concentrate  on cost-effective  approaches  and control  measures  which  in the meantime  can 
significantly  reduce  dengue  vector  density  and disease  transmission,  such  as improved  and expanded 
vector  monitoring,  appropriate  vector  control  and proper  waste  management; 
(3) to expand  diagnostic  capabilities  and strengthen  clinical  and epidemiological  surveillance  for 
dengue  and dengue  haemorrhagic  fever  to better  define  their  distribution  and burden; 
(4) to establish,  in collaboration  with WHO,  safe and economic  measures  for the prevention  and 
control  of dengue,  including  planned  urban  development  and the provision  of safe and dependable  water 
supplies  through  coordinated  efforts  in the public  and private  sectors; 
(5) to increase  numbers  of well trained  staff  at all institutional  levels  for the planning  and 
implementation  of dengue  operations  and reduction  of mortality  through  improved  clinical  management; 
(6) to strengthen  research  on the pathophysiology  of dengue  infections;  to improve  community  health 
education;  to encourage  health  promotion  and better  hygiene;  and to increase  awareness  and the 
capacity  for action  at the community  level; 
(7) to facilitate  Phase  III field  efficacy  trials,  testing  candidate  dengue  vaccines; 
3. URGES  other  specialized  agencies  and organizations  of the United  Nations  system，bilateral 
development  agencies,  nongovernmental  organizations  and other  groups  concerned，to  increase  their 
cooperation  in dengue  prevention  and control  both through  continued  support  for general  health  and social 
development  and through  specific  support  to national  and international  dengue  prevention  and control 
programmes,  including  emergency  control; 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to establish,  in consultation  with affected  Member  States，strategies  to contain  the spread  and 
increasing  incidence  of dengue,  dengue  haemorrhagic  fever  and dengue  shock  syndrome  in a manner 
sustainable  by countries;  , 
(2) to draw  up plans  for emergency  health  cooperation  against  outbreaks  of dengue  and coordinate 
their implementation  with  interested  agencies  and other  groups; 
(3) to increase  WHO，s  capacity，within  available  resources，for  directing  and strengthening  research  in 
dengue  surveillance，epidemiology  and vaccine  development,  and to guide  Member  States  in the 
prevention  and control  of dengue,  including  vector  control; 
(4) to coordinate  dengue  prevention  and control  in cooperation  with other  specialized  agencies  and 
organizations  of the United  Nations  system,  bilateral  development  agencies，nongovernmental 
organizations  and other  groups  concerned; 
(5) to increase  efforts  to find extrabudgetary  resources  for support  to national  and international 
dengue  prevention  and control  activities; 
(6) to keep  the Executive  Board  and the Health  Assembly  informed  of progress  in the implementation 
of this resolution.
