WHA5.50  WHO  Seals 
The Fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  that  the sale  of WHO  seals  is impracticable  or undesirable  in certain  Member  countries  ; 
Believing  that  in other  countries  the sale  of WHO  seals  will  not conflict  with  the fund-raising  activities 
of voluntary  health  agencies  ; 
Recommending  that,  in making  the decision  as to whether  WHO  seals  are to be sold,  the government 
of each  country  take  fully  into  account  the  interests  of its voluntary  health  agencies, 
1. RESOLVES  that  WHO  seals  shall  continue  to be supplied  by the Organization  and  placed  at the disposal 
of Member  governments  on request,  either  for their  own  use  or for the use of national  voluntary  health 
agencies  whose  purposes  are in conformity  with  the principles  set forth  in the Constitution  of the World 
Health  Organization,  and 
2. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to implement  this  decision  in conformity  with  the  conditions  set 
forth  in resolution  WHA4.48  of the  Fourth  World  Health  Assembly.37
