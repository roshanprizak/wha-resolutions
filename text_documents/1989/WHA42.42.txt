Agenda item 18.2 19 May 1989 
WOMEN'S HEALTH 
The Forty-second  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA28.40,  WHA29.43,  WHA31.37,  WHA36.21  and WHA40.27; 
Recognizing  the importance  of an integrated  approach  to the health of women and the 
crucial role of women in development; 
Concerned  that the physical,  social and mental health of women in many countries 
continues  to be threatened  by discrimination,  by deteriorating  social and economic 
circumstances,  and insufficient  priority  being given to the development  and maintenance 
of relevant  health and social services  for women; 
Aware that maternal  morbidity  and mortality  can be substantially  reduced  by simple, 
effective  and culturally  acceptable  measures  and methods,  and that the application  of 
such measures  and methods  constitutes  a highly profitable  investment; 
Cognizant  of the need to ensure that a woman's perspective  is reflected  in the 
policies  and programmes  of the health and other sectors  affecting  the health of women, 
and that effective  non-discriminatory  implementation  and enforcement  are required  even 
for those policies  and programmes  that already  exist; 
Recognizing  that although  the burden of childbearing  and child care falls on women, 
many societies  have all too often failed to provide  them with adequate  technical  and 
social support,  and have yet to make a commitment  to safe motherhood; 
1. URGES Member States which have not already  done so: 
(1) to recognize  the social significance  and implications  of women's  health; 
(2) to recognize  the severity  of the health risks incurred  by women, particularly 
in connection  with pregnancy  and delivery,  and to publicize  and utilize  the adequate 
methods for preventing  these risks； 
(3) to examine  the health,  social,  cultural  and economic  circumstances  of women and 
to implement  an integrated  and comprehensive  approach  on the basis of this analysis, 
including  in the process  the full participation  of women； 
(4) to utilize  actively  the experience,  expertise  and common concerns  of 
nongovernmental  organizations,  particularly  those of obstetricians  and 
gynaecologists,  midwives  and nurses,  as well as women's  groups in the formulation, 
implementation  and evaluation  of programmes  for women's  health;

(5) to ensure that the health and social services  necessary  to sustain  women's 
health are accessible  to all on a non-discriminatory  basis；

2. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to continue  to assist Member States in their efforts  to ensure adequate  and 
equitable  health care for women by strengthening  the Organization's  technical 
support at all levels,  particularly  in the areas of research  and research  training

particularly  those of obstetricians  and gynaecologists,  midwives  and nurses,  and 
women's groups,  at national,  regional  and global levels； 
(4) to maintain  and strengthen  intersectoral  approaches  through  collaboration  with
