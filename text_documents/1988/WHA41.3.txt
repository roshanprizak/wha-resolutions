EXPRESSION  OF APPRECIATION  TO DR HALFDAN MAHLER 
The Forty-first  World Health  Assembly, 
Expressing  its profound  gratitude  to Dr Halfdan  T. Mahler  for his outstanding 
services  to health  and development  the world over throughout  his long career  in the World 
Health Organization,  and in particular  as its Director-General  from 1973 to 1988； 
Paying tribute  in particular  to his personal  qualities  of integrity,  sincerity  and 
leadership,  his wide knowledge  of all aspects  of health,  and his deep emotional  and moral 
commitment  to WHO and everything  it stands  for; 
Appreciating  his staunch  stand for the health  of people  everywhere,  both for its 
humane value and for its contribution  to social  and economic  development,  and deeply 
moved by his empathy  regarding  the underprivileged,  particularly  the people  of the 
developing  countries； 
Sharing  his moral conscience  concerning  the gap between  those who have the means of 
promoting  and maintaining  their health  and ensuring  appropriate  health  care when 
necessary  and those who do not have such means,  and emphasizing  his unceasing  efforts 
throughout  his life to close that gap and to inspire  others  to equal efforts； 
Considering  that under his inspired  leadership  the World Health  Organization  has 
fulfilled  more strongly  than ever its constitutional  role of directing  and coordinating 
authority  on international  health  work; 
DECLARES  Dr Halfdan  T. Mahler  Director-General  Emeritus  of the World Health 
Organization  as from the date of his retirement.
