WHA26.29  Smallpox  eradication  programme 
The Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  Director-General's  report  on the  smallpox  eradication  programme; 
Appreciating  the  decisive  contribution  made  to the  global  eradication  effort  by the  many  countries 
which  have  succeeded  in eliminating  endemic  smallpox,  and  recognizing  with  gratitude  the  efforts  being 
made  by those  where  the disease  still  exists  ； 
Noting  with  concern,  however,  that  in some  areas  of the countries  where  endemic  smallpox  persists  the 
situation  presently  appears  more  serious  than  in previous  years  ； 
Reaffirming,  therefore,  the necessity  to make  every  possible  effort  to ensure  the speedy  progress  of eradication  and  to maintain  it where  it is achieved, 
1. REQUESTS  all countries  to give  the highest  priority  to the smallpox  eradication  programme,  with  particular 
emphasis  on active  surveillance,  so as to interrupt  transmission  of the disease  at the earliest  possible  time 
in the areas  where  it is still  endemic  and  to prevent  reoccurrence  of the disease  in countries  from  which  it has 
been  eliminated; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to continue  to give  all necessary  assistance  to the  countries  concerned 
in order  to support  and  accelerate  national  eradication  efforts,  to determine  through  independent  evaluation 
whether  eradication  has  actually  been  achieved,  and  to identify  the additional  resources,  both  national  and 
international,  which  may  be required  for the successful  completion  of the programme  ； and 
3. THANKS  the countries  that  have  generously  contributed  to the programme,  either  bilaterally  or through 
the WHO  Voluntary  Fund  for  Health  Promotion,  in the  confident  hope  that  continued  support  will  be 
provided  to the programme,  especially  during  the critical  years  ahead.
