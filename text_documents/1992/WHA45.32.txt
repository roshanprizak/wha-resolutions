Agenda  item 20.3 14  May 1992 
INTERNATIONAL  PROGRAMME  ON CHEMICAL  SAFETY 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA30.47,  WHA31.28  and  EB63.R19  on the evaluation  of the effects  of chemicals 
on health,  and  resolution  EB73.R10  on the International  Programme  on Chemical  Safety; 
Noting  that  under  the leadership  of WHO  the  Programme  has  become  an interagency  cooperative 
activity  with  ILO  and  UNEP,  well  coordinated  and  collaborating  closely  with  programmes  on related  subjects 
of other  organizations,  such  as FAO  and  OECD; 
Noting  also  that  relevant  recommendations  had  been  adopted  during  a meeting  of governmentdesignated  experts  on chemical  risk  assessment  and  management,1  held  in the context  of the preparations  for 
the United  Nations  Conference  on Environment  and  Development,  foreseeing  an expanded  role  for the 
International  Programme  in ensuring  effective  coordination  of chemical  risk  assessment  and  risk  management 
activities  of international  organizations, 
1. URGES  Member  States: 
(1) to  establish  or strengthen  governmental  mechanisms  to provide  liaison  and  coordination  between 
all parties  involved  in chemical  safety  activities  (e.g.,  authorities  and  institutions  for agriculture, 
education,  health,  industry,  labour,  environment,  transport,  civil  defence,  economic  affairs,  research  and 
poison  control,  etc.); 
(2) to  establish  or strengthen  national  and  local  capabilities  for response  to accidents  including 
networks  of emergency  response  and  poison  control  centres; 
(3) to  increase  awareness,  among  the general  public  and  certain  professional  and  other  groups,  of 
chemical  risks  and  the need  to prevent  misuse  of chemicals  and  accidental  exposure  to them; 
(4) to  organize,  in collaboration  with  industry,  trade  unions,  professional  bodies  and  consumer 
associations,  training  programmes  for staff  at all levels  in chemical  safety,  including  emergency  response; 
(5) to  increase  financial,  scientific  and  logistic  support  to the International  Programme  (a) through  the 
Voluntary  Fund  for Health  Promotion;  (b)  through  national  institutions  participating  in the Programme; 
and (c) through  funds  held  in countries  for the Programme;  and  to encourage  industry  and  national 
institutions  to provide  the Programme  with  timely  data  and  other  support  needed  for risk  assessment;

2. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to  recognize  the importance  of the International  Programme  in the development  and 
implementation  of a new  WHO  strategy  for environmental  health,  taking  into  consideration  the findings 
of the WHO  Commission  on Health  and  Environment  and  the recommendations  of the meeting  of 
government-designated  experts  referred  to above; 
(2) to  strengthen  and  expand  the scientific  work  of the Programme  to meet  the current  and  foreseen 
challenges  of chemical  safety,  incorporating  all aspects  of WHO's  work  on risk assessment,  including 
epidemiological  and  exposure  assessment  activities; 
(3) to  continue  to promote  the development  of comprehensive  chemical  safety  programmes  directed 
towards  the needs  of countries  in all the WHO  regions,  and  the effective  implementation  of such 
programmes  through  concerted  action  at global,  regional  and  national  levels; 
(4) to  review  the current  arrangements  with  the Executive  Heads  of ILO  and  UNEP,  as well  as with 
representatives  of other  organizations  that  might  participate  in the International  Programme  in the 
future,  in order  to determine  the changes  that  would  be required  for its expanded  role,  including  the 
function  of secretariat  for an intergovernmental  forum  on chemical  safety,  as recommended  in proposals 
to be presented  to governments  at the United  Nations  Conference  on Environment  and  Development; 
(5) to  ensure  that  the funding  of the Programme  by Member  States  and  cooperating  organizations  is 
sustainable  in the long  term; 
(6) to  take  steps  to ensure  that  in expanding  the chemical  risk management  tasks  of the Programme, 
the scientific  quality  and  integrity  of the work  on risk assessment  are fully  protected; 
(7) to  report  to a future  session  of the Executive  Board  on the expanded  International  Programme, 
particularly  in relation  to the enhanced  role  of WHO  with  its partners  in implementation  of the decisions 
of the United  Nations  Conference  on Environment  and  Development  for environmentally  sound 
chemical  risk management.
