Constitution  of the World  Health  Organization  remain  appropriate  and relevant;  and if the Executive  Board 
concludes  there  is a need for a review  of the Constitution,  to consider  how best the review  of the Constitution 
should  be taken  forward; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to report  to the Forty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly  in 1996  on
