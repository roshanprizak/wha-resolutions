RECALLS resolution WHA41.28 which committed WHO to the global eradication of poliomyelitis by the year 2000 and, inter alia, emphasized that eradication efforts should be pursued in ways which strengthen the development of the Expanded Programme on Immunization as a whole, fostering its contribution, in turn, to the development of the health infrastructure and of primary health care; 1 See document EB83 / 1989 / REC / 2, summary records of the Board's eleventh and twelfth meetings.

WARNS both developing countries and outside collaborators that they will need to increase their investments in immunization if full coverage is tobe achieved and sustained during the 1990s and if the targets for reduction in the number of cases of measles and neonatal tetanus and for eradication of poliomyelitis are tobe achieved; 7. ENCOURAGES those concerned to make these investments, noting the special demands which the poliomyelitis eradication initiative is now making on WHO extrabudgetary resources 8. REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to pursue the actions outlined in his report pertaining to the achievement and maintenance of full immunization coverage, control of the target diseases, introduction of new or improved vaccines, and promotion of other primary health care practices and research and development (2) to pursue the action outlined in resolution WHA41.28 with respect to the eradication of poliomyelitis (3) to continue to seek from extrabudge tary sources the contributions required to support these activities (4) to continue to keep the Health Assembly informed of the progress of the Expanded Programme, including progress in the eradication of poliomyelitis by the year 2000.
