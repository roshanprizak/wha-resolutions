Reducing global measles mortality 
 
The Fifty-sixth World Health Assembly, 
Alarmed by the unacceptable burden of nearly 800 000 measles deaths annually, occurring 
mostly in infants and young children living in developing countries; 
Recognizing that the current disease burden of measles is the result of underutilization of 
measles vaccine caused by inadequately supporte d immunization programmes and disease surveillance 
systems; 
Stressing the importance of achieving the goa l adopted by the United Nations General 
Assembly special session on children (2002) to re duce deaths due to measles by half by 2005, 
compared with the 1999 level, and the target cont ained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration 
to reduce the under-five child mortality ra te by two-thirds by the year 2015; 
Recognizing the availability of safe, effectiv e and inexpensive meas les vaccines and proven 
strategies to reduce measles mortality; 
Welcoming the remarkable progress that has been made by the Measles Initiative partnership to 
reduce measles deaths in Africa; 
Noting the critical importance of routine immunization services as the foundation of a strategy 
to reduce measles deaths in a sustainable manner, an d the essential role of integrated epidemiological 
and laboratory surveillance for measles in guiding control efforts; 
Having considered the report on the strategy fo r child and adolescent hea lth and development, 
which identifies measles as one of the five prev entable communicable diseases that account for the 
vast majority of childhood deaths, 
1. URGES Member States:
