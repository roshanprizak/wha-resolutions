CONTROL OF DISEASE  VECTORS  AND PESTS 
The Forty-second  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  Health Assembly  resolutions  WHA35.17  and WHA38.24,  and the Executive 
Board's resolution  EB83.R16; 
Noting that a number of serious  vector-borne  diseases  continues  to be major public 
health problems  and a severe burden on scarce resources  for health in both developed  and 
developing  countries； 
Concerned  by the recent extensive  epidemics  of vector-borne  diseases  with high 
mortality  rates, particularly  in Asia, Africa,  and Latin America; 
Equally concerned  by the impact of urbanization,  population  movements  and the 
exploitation  of natural  resources  on the incidence  of vector-borne  diseases； 
Aware that improved  intersectoral  collaboration  in the planning,  design,  and 
implementation  of natural  resource  and agricultural  development  activities  would help 
improve the situation  with regard to vector-borne  diseases； 
Recognizing  that vector control  and the appropriate  and selective  use of pesticides 
continue  to be essential  for the control  of most vector-borne  diseases  of public health 
importance  and for protection  of the environment； 
Noting that there are at present  promising  new technologies  for vector control  that 
warrant accelerated  testing  for eventual  use in field settings； 
Concerned  by the shortage  of adequately  trained  specialists  in vector monitoring  and 
control； 
1. AFFIRMS  that disease  vector control  must remain a global priority  of WHO; 
2. URGES  Member States: 
(1) to reinforce  the capacity  of the general  health services  and other 
institutions,  as appropriate,  to ensure that effective  measures  are taken for the 
control of disease  vectors,  in accordance  with the principles  approved  by the Health 
Assembly; 
(2) to develop  and maintain  adequate  human resources  at all institutional  levels 
for the appropriate  planning  and implementation  of disease  vector and nuisance  pest 
control operations； 
(3) to establish  sound arrangements  to facilitate  the involvement  of the health 
sector in natural  resources  development  planning;

3. CALLS  UPON donor agencies  and development  banks to include  in development  projects 
components  specifically  dealing  with vector-borne  diseases  and the use of pesticides  in 
order to ensure the optimum  protection  of human health; 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to ensure that WHO's input in the development  of effective  and safe methods  for 
the control  of disease  vectors  and nuisance  pests continues  to be based on sound 
ecological  considerations,  in full accordance  with the principles  of sustainable 
development; 
(2) to broaden  existing  collaborative  efforts  between  WHO and FAO in promoting  the 
effective  and safe use of pesticides； 
(3) to reinforce  existing  collaboration  between  WHO, other specialized  agencies 
within the United Nations  system,  and appropriate  donors for ensuring  that control 
of disease  vectors  is taken into account  in natural  resources  development  projects； 
(4) to continue  to pay due attention  to the control  of vectors  and pests and to 
develop appropriate  activities  in this area in consultation  with the Executive  Board 
and the Health Assembly.
