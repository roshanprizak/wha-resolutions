FORTY-EIGHTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY 
Agenda  item  18.2 WHA48.26 
12 May  1995 
Reorientation  of allocations 
The Forty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Aware  of the great  inequities  persisting  between  developed  and developing  countries  where  health  status 
is concerned,  and the lack  of human,  material  and financial  resources  in the developing  countries  to cope  with 
their urgent  health  problems  and  establish  national  health  services; 
Noting  with  deep  concern  that  there  has been  no real growth  in the WHO  budget  for the last ten years, 
and that  the instability  of financial  markets  is causing  unforeseeable  cost  increases; 
Recalling  resolution  WHA29.48,  whereby  the Director-General  was  requested  to cut down  "all avoidable 
and non-essential  expenditure  on establishment  and  administration",  and  the effect  of that  resolution  in 
achieving  an orientation  of 60%  of the regular  budget  towards  technical  cooperation, 
REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  and the Director-General: 
(1) to  initiate,  as part  of the process  of budgetary  reform,  a process  of biennial  budgetary  transfers 
from  global  and  interregional  activities  to priority  health  programmes  at country  level,  in the context 
of priorities  recommended  by the Board,  starting  with  a 2% transfer  in the 1998-1999  programme 
budget,  and to regularly  review  this  need  in every  biennium  in order  to achieve  maximum  transfer  of 
resources  to priority  health  programmes  at country  level; 
(2) to  ensure  that  the respective  proposed  programme  budgets  show  from  which  programme  areas 
the transfer  has been  effected; 
(3) to  report  to the Forty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly  on steps  taken  in implementing  this 
resolution.
