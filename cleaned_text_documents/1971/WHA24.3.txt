CONCURS with the Board's conclusion that the revised method of work which, inaccordance with the Health Assembly's decision, was introduced as from the Twenty-third World Health Assembly has resulted in a more equitable workload of the main committees and has enabled the Health Assembly, in spite of increased activities, to complete its work within a three-week period; 2. DECIDES to make no change in the revised method of work other than as stated in paragraph 3 below; 3. DECIDES to delete from its agenda as a separate item the consideration of the general order of magnitude of the budget for the second ensuing year and to examine this matter at the time that it discusses the effective working budget level for the budget year; 4. NOTES the decision of the Board to keep under review the method of work of the Health Assembly; and 5. REQUESTS the Executive Board to report as appropriate on other steps for further improving the methods of work of the Health Assembly. Handb. Res., 11th ed 4.1.3 Tenth plenary meeting, 12 May 1971 (Committee B, first report)
