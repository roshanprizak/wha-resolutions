Agenda item 15.3 28 May  2016 
Addressing the burden of mycetoma  
 
The Sixty-ninth  World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on mycetoma,1 
Deeply concerned about the impact of mycetoma, especially among children and young adults 
of working age, and the public health and socioeconomic burdens that the disease places on poor, rural 
communities;  
Aware that early detection and treatmen t minimize the adverse consequences of mycetoma;  
Noting with satisfaction the progress made by some Member States with regard to research into 
mycetoma and management of cases of the disease;  
Concerned that several factors, including late detection of case s of mycetoma and inadequacy of 
available tools for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the disease, impede further progress;  
Mindful that achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and the Goals 
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable De velopment,2 particularly those concerning poverty, hunger, 
health and education, may be hampered by the negative impact of neglected diseases of the poor, 
including mycetoma,  
1. CALLS UPON the international community and all stakeholders including, inter a lia, 
international organizations, bodies of the United Nations system, donors, nongovernmental 
organizations, foundations and research institutions:  
(1) to cooperate directly with countries in which mycetoma is endemic, upon the request of 
such countries, in order to strengthen control activities;  
(2) to develop partnerships and foster collaboration with organizations and programmes 
involved in health system development in order to ensure that effective interventions can reach 
all those in need;  
(3) to support institutions working on research into mycetoma;

2 2. ENCOURAGES Member States in which mycetoma is, or threatens to become, endemic:  
(1) to assess the burden of mycetoma and, where necessary, establish a control programme;  
(2) to accelerate efforts f or early detection and treatment of mycetoma cases;  
(3) to integrate, where feasible, efforts to control mycetoma with other relevant 
disease -control activities;  
(4) within the context of health -system development, to establish and sustain partnerships for  
control of mycetoma at country and regional levels;  
(5) to meet control needs, including in respect of improved access to treatment and 
rehabilitation services, by mobilizing national resources;  
(6) to provide training to relevant health workers on the ma nagement of mycetoma;  
(7) to intensify research in order to develop new tools to diagnose, treat and prevent 
mycetoma;  
(8) to promote community awareness of disease symptoms in support of early detection and 
prevention of mycetoma, and to intensify communi ty participation in control efforts;  
3. REQUESTS the Director -General:  
(1) to include mycetoma among the diseases termed “neglected tropical diseases”;  
(2) to continue to offer technical support to institutions working on research into mycetoma, 
including WHO collaborating centres, in support of improved, evidence -based disease control 
efforts;  
(3) to support Member States in which mycetoma is endemic to strengthen capacities for 
improving early detection and access to treatment;  
(4) to foster technical coo peration among countries as a means of strengthening mycetoma 
surveillance, control and rehabilitation services;  
(5) through the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and 
Training in Tropical Diseases, to support the strengthening of re search capacity in order to meet 
the need for better diagnostics, treatments and preventive tools for mycetoma;  
(6) through the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Neglected Tropical Diseases, to 
define a systematic, technically -driven process for e valuation and potential inclusion of 
additional diseases among the “neglected tropical diseases”;  
(7) to report on progress in implementing this resolution to the Seventy -second World Health 
Assembly.
