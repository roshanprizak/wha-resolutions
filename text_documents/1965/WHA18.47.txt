WHA18.47  Control  Measures  for Certain  Dependence-producing  Drugs 
The Eighteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  that  international  narcotics  control  has  been  operating  successfully  for several  decades; 
Noting  with  great  concern  the  increasing  frequency  of abuse  of sedatives  or stimulants  not  classified 
internationally  as narcotic  drugs,  as has  also  been  noted  by the  United  Nations  Commission  on Narcotic 
Drugs,  and  being  aware  of the  epidemic-like  spreading  of this  abuse,  particularly  among  young  persons 
in certain  countries; 
Referring  to the repeated  recommendations  of the WHO  Expert  Committee  on Dependence-producing 
Drugs  concerning  the  need  for  control  of certain  sedatives  and  stimulants; 
Convinced  that  an important  factor  in fighting  the  abuse  of narcotics  and  other  dependence-producing 
drugs  is, by means  of international  conventions,  to limit  their  availability  to legitimate  medical  purposes 
only;  and 
Realizing  that  national  efforts  to control  this  health  problem  are  often  insufficient, 
1. CONCLUDES  that  control  of widely  abused  sedatives  and  stimulants,  such  as barbiturates,  tranquillizers 
and amphetamines,  is desirable; 
2. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  States  which  have  not  already  done  so place  such  drugs  on medical 
prescription  ; 
3. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  States  promote  an intensive  health  education  action  with  regard  to the 
dangers  of the abuse  of sedatives  and  stimulants; 
4. RECOMMENDS  the promotion  of further  research  into  the epidemiology  of drug  dependence;  and 
5. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to study  the  advisability  and  feasibility  of international  measures  for 
control  of sedatives  and  stimulants.
