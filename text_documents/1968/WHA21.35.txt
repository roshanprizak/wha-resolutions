WHA21.35  Study  of the Criteria  for assessing  the Equivalenee  of Medical  Degrees  in Different  Countries 
The Twenty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  the  information  on existing  legislation  on medical  qualifications  and  the  practice  of medicine 
in forty  countries  or territories; 
Noting  the  information  on the  number  of years  of education  required  for  obtaining  a medical  degree 
and a licence  in different  countries; 
Noting  further  the  compilation  of degrees  and  diplomas  corresponding  to additional  qualifications  in 
special  fields  referred  to in the  legislation  of twenty-seven  countries; 
Noting  that  the  Regional  Committee  for  Africa  at its seventeenth  session  adopted  a resolution  relating 
to the  problem  of uniformity  of standards  in recruitment  and  training  of candidates  in the  medical  and 
paramedical  professions;1 
Agreeing  with  the  need  to differentiate  between: 
{a) the  legal  aspect  of the right  to practise  medicine  in different  countries;  and 
(b) the  comparability  of standards  of professional  competence  resulting  from  different  systems  of 
medical  education; 
Reaffirming  the importance  of promoting  exchanges  between  countries  for  post-graduate  training  and 
experience,  provided  that  doctors  from  developing  countries  are  encouraged  to return  to those  countries 
where  their  skills  are most  required;  and 
Welcoming  the  decision  to convene  an advisory  group  to consider  what  further  steps  are  desirable  in 
studying  the  equivalence  of medical  degrees, 
1. THANKS  the  Director-General  for  the report  on his study  of the criteria  for assessing  the equivalence  of 
medical  degrees  in different  countries; 
2. INVITES  the Director-General  to consider  holding  the first  meeting  of the advisory  group  when  the report 
is available  of the UNESCO  expert  committee  meeting  on the  international  comparability  and  equivalence 
of secondary  school  certificates,  diplomas  and  university  degrees; 
3. REQUESTS  the  Director-General: 
(a) to  study  those  factors  in medical  education  which  promote  or hinder  the capacity  of newly  qualified 
doctors  to adapt  their  medical  skills  to the  needs  of different  countries  and  situations; 
(b) to  consider  what  steps  should  be taken  by employing  authorities  to familiarize  with  local  needs 
medical  personnel  trained  in other  countries;  and 
(r) to  promote  further  study  to develop  methods  of assessing  the  comparability  of different  programmes  of medical  education;  and 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to report  to the  Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly.
