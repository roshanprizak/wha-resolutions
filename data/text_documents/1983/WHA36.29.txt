countries  seriously  affected  by drought  and famine；

their countries； 
Bearing in mind that many of the African  States affected  by drought  and fâroine are âinong 
the least developed  countries；

preventive  measures  for the future,  these countries  need to set up integrated  programmes  in 
the health field as well as for the recovery  and improvement  of agricultural  activities；

essential  social and public services；

situation  is becoming  increasingly  serious  ；
