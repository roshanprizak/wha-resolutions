WHA9.62  Fixing  of Target  Dates  for starting  Inter-regional  Co-ordinated  Programmes  for Malaria  Control leading  to Eradication 
The Ninth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Being  convinced  that  it is highly  desirable  to obtain  malaria  control  simultaneously  in as large  areas 
as possible,  for  increasing  the  efficiency  of the campaigns  and  effecting  economy,  eventually  leading  to 
eradication  of malaria  in border  areas  between  countries  and  regions, 
RECOMMENDS  that  the World  Health  Organization  offer,  subject  to availability  of funds,  appropriate 
assistance  in the  forms  that  may  be required  by governments.
