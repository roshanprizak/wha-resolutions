The Forty-eighth World Health Assembly, Noting with concern that, as at 31 December 1994: (a) the rate of collection in 1994 of contributions to the effective working budget for that year amounted to 80.32%, leaving US$ 79 846 675 unpaid; (b) only 99 Members had paid their contributions to the effective working budget for that year in full, and 72 Members had made no payment; (c) unpaid arrears of contributions to the effective working budget in respect of 1993 and prior years exceeded US$ 52 million, 1. EXPRESSES concern at the level of outstanding contributions, which has had a deleterious effect on programmes and on the financial situation; 2. CALLS THE ATTENTION of all Members to Financial Regulation 5.6, which provides that instalments of contributions and advances shall be considered as due and payable in full by the first day of the year to which they relate, and to the importance of paying contributions as early as possible to enable the Director-General to implement the programme budget in an orderly manner; 3. REMINDS Members that, as a result of the adoption, by resolution WHA41.12, of an incentive scheme to promote the timely payment of assessed contributions, those that pay their assessed contributions early in the year in which they are due will have their contributions payable fora subsequent programme budget reduced appreciably, whereas Members paying later will have their contributions payable for that subsequent programme budget reduced only marginally or not at all; 4. URGES Members that are regularly late in the payment of their contributions to take as rapidly as possible all steps necessary to ensure prompt and regular payment; 5. REQUESTS the Director-General to draw this resolution to the attention of all Members. Eleventh plenary meeting, 8 May 1995 A48 / VR / 11 I
