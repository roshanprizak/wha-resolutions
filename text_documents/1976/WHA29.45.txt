The Twenty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the  Director-General  on  WHO's  human  health  and  environment 
programme; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA26.58,  WHA27.49,  WHA27.50  and  WHA28.63; 
Considering  that  progress  in improving  the conditions  of the human  environment  as they  affect  health 
is too slow,  and  that  present  efforts  by all concerned  require  intensification; 
Emphasizing  that  the improvement  of environmental  conditions  should  be seen  as part  of the total  health 
and development  effort  ； 
Stressing  the  particular  priority  to be given  to environmental  sanitation  in the  developing  countries, 
especially  to the provision  of adequate  and  potable  water  and  the disposal  of wastes; 
Recognizing,  however,  that  all countries  must  pay  increasing  attention  to the  prevention  of adverse 
effects  on health  resulting  from  conditions  in various  environments  to which  man  is exposed  ； 
Reaffirming  the priority  of health  in the context  of environmental  programmes  and  the  need  for close 
cooperation  in this  field; 
1. THANKS  the Director-General  for  his report,  and  endorses  the approach  to the future  development  and 
implementation  of the programme; 
2. REITERATES  that  WHO  should  collaborate  with  governments  in the development  of their  environmental 
health  services  and  infrastructures; 
3. URGES  governments  :

(2) to  allocate  adequate  resources  to environmental  health  ； 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to  plan  and  implement  the programme  on the basis  of the proposals  made  in his report  and  taking 
into account  resolutions  WHA26.58,  WHA27.49,  WHA27.50  and  WHA28.63; 
(2) to  continue  to follow  a multidisciplinary  approach  and  to integrate  the  various  programme  areas 
into a comprehensive  programme,  as proposed  in his report; 
(3) to  continue  collaboration  and  coordination  within  the United  Nations  system,  especially  with  the 
United  Nations  Environment  Programme,  and  with  other  intergovernmental  and  nongovernmental 
agencies  concerned  with  environmental  matters,  with  a view  to: 
(a) maintaining  WHO，s  leading  role  in respect  of activities  to promote  human  health  ； 
ф) increasing  the availability  of resources  in addition  to the regular  budget  of the Organization; 
and 
(c) making  the Organization's  contribution  to environmental  programmes  as effective  as possible;
