TUBERCULOSIS  CONTROL  IN THE WORLD - SITUATION  ANALYSIS 
The Thirty-sixth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  WHA33.26; 
Having considered  the Director-General1  s report on tuberculosis  control; 
Noting that tuberculosis  continues  to be an important  health problem in the world, 
particularly  in developing  countries,  where little improvement  has been achieved  in the' 
last two decades; 
Recognizing  that improvement  in socioeconomic  conditions  will have a beneficial  effect 
on the tuberculosis  situation; 
Emphasizing  that progress  in tuberculosis  control  requires  a sustained  effort and that 
the programme  must be integrated  into comprehensive  health systems  based on primary health 
care; 
Convinced  that the social target of alleviating  human suffering  and preventing  death 
and disability  from tuberculosis  is achievable  in the context of primary health care and in 
accordance  with the goal of health for all by the year 2000; 
Recognizing  that the epidemiological  target of interrupting  tuberculosis  transmission 
and substantially  reducing  the magnitude  of the tuberculosis  problem in the world can only 
be achieved  gradually; 
Expressing  its appreciation  of the collaboration  of the International  Union against 
Tuberculosis  and other nongovernmental  organizations  in furthering  the general policy of 
WHO in tuberculosis  control; 
1. URGES Member States to intensify  their efforts to extend tuberculosis  diagnostic, 
treatment  and prevention  services  to the whole population,  and to do this by promoting 
close collaboration  between those responsible  for the development  and organization  of 
health system infrastructure  based on primary health care and those responsible  for 
tuberculosis  control; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to continue  to collaborate  with Member States in the development  and 
strengthening  of tuberculosis  control programmes  as a component  of primary health 
care, and to ensure that expertise  in tuberculosis  control  remains available  to 
the international  and national  communities; 
(2) to continue  to support BCG vaccination  in children  within the Expanded 
Programme  on Immunization  in accordance  with the present policy of the Organization; 
(3) to promote sociological  and health systems research  in order to establish 
baselines  for programme  planning  and evaluation  and to determine  the most efficient 
ways of delivering  the appropriate  technologies  through the health system 
infrastructure  and of ensuring  community  participation; 
WHA36 .30

(4) to promote  fundamental  and technological  research,  particularly  in the fields 
of epidemiology  and immunology,  aimed at providing  more effective  preventive  and 
diagnostic  methods; 
(5) to promote collaboration  between  tuberculosis  programmes  and programmes 
concerned  with the organization  of health systems  based on primary  health care, 
health laboratory  technology  programmes,  drug action programmes,  and programmes 
in public information  and health education; 
(6) to promote the development  and strengthening  of training  programmes  on the 
technical  and management  aspects  of tuberculosis  control  as an integral  part of 
the curricula  for the training  of all categories  of health personnel; 
(7) to make all possible  efforts,  through  collaboration  between  the action 
programme  on essential  drugs and the pharmaceutical  industry,  to ensure that 
the most effective  chemotherapeutic  regimens  become more widely accessible  to 
developing  countries; 
(8) to keep the Executive  Board and the Health Assembly  informed  of global 
progress  in tuberculosis  control.
