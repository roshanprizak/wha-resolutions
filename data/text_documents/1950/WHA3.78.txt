WHA3.78  Report  on Absentee  Members  of the Executive  Board 
The Third  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on absentee  Members  of the Executive  Board  ;111 
Believing  that  repeated  and  consecutive  absences  from  sessions  of the Board  by the person  designated 
by any  Member  may  give  rise  to a presumption  that  such  Member  has  withdrawn  from  the Board  ; 
Noting  that  the person  designated  by the Byelorussian  SSR,  although  duly  notified,  has not attended  the 
second,  third,  fourth  and  fifth  sessions  of the Board  ; 
Considering  that  the consequent  presumption  that  the Byelorussian  SSR  has withdrawn  from  the Board 
is strengthened  by the fact  that  no response  was  made  by the Byelorussian  SSR  to the invitation  made  by the 
Second  World  Health  Assembly  to attend  the sessions  of the Executive  Board  ; 
Considering  that  the continuing  absence  of one  or more  persons  designated  to serve  on the Board  by 
Members  so entitled  can  hamper  the Board  in the exercise  of its functions, 
1. DEEMS  that  the Byelorussian  SSR  has  withdrawn  from  the Board,  and, 
Considering  the provisions  of Article  24 of the Constitution  of the World  Health  Organization  and  of 
Rule  84 of the Rules  of Procedure  of the World  Health  Assembly, 
2. DECIDES  to proceed  to the election  of a Member  entitled  to designate  a person  to serve  on the Board  for 
one year.

Finance  and  Legal  Matters  adopted  at fifth  plenary 
meeting,  16 May  1950)  [A3/R/16]
