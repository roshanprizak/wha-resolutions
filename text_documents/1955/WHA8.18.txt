WHA8.18  Accession  to the Convention  on the Privileges  and  Immunities  of the Specialized  Agencies 
The Eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  noted  the  relatively  small  number  of Member  States  that  have  acceded  to the  Convention 
on the  Privileges  and  Immunities  of the  Specialized  Agencies  ; 
Noting  that  in the  territories  of the  governments  which  have  not  acceded  to this  Convention  or 
are not  already  bound  by a similar  instrument  there  have  been  or may  be difficulties  regarding  the legal 
status  of the staff  of the Organization  and  particularly  of its project  personnel  under  the regular  budget 
and the  Technical  Assistance  funds  ; 
Recognizing  that  the  best  way  to solve  these  difficulties  would  be the accession  to this  Convention 
and its Annex  VII  by Members  of the  Organization, 
URGES  Members  not yet parties  to the Convention  on the Privileges  and  Immunities  of the Specialized 
Agencies,  or to instruments  conferring  similar  privileges,  to accede  to this  Convention  and  to its Annex  VII 
and, pending  such  accession,  to accord  to the World  Health  Organization  by executive  action  the benefit 
of the  privileges  and  immunities  which  this  Convention  and  its annex  provide.

third  report  of the  Committee  on  Administration, 
Finance  and  Legal  Matters)
