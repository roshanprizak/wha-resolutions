FORTY-SIXTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY WHA46.36 
Agenda  item  19 14  May  1993 
TUBERCULOSIS  PROGRAMME 
The Forty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  WHA44.8  which  endorsed  a dual approach  with a global  target  of successful 
treatment  of 85% of detected  sputum-positive  patients  and detection  of 70% of such cases  by the year 2000; 
Aware  that tuberculosis  remains  one of the most important  causes  of death  despite  the existence  of 
highly  cost-effective  strategies  and the availability  of tools  to control  the disease; 
Recognizing  that the already  serious  situation  is rapidly  worsening  in both developing  and industrialized 
countries  as the result  of not emphasizing  tuberculosis  as a priority  programme,  economic  recession,  appalling 
conditions  in many  parts  of the world  due to war, civil disorders，famine  and other  calamities,  spread  of HIV 
infection,  and increased  international  migration; 
Stressing  that there  is a severe  lack of political  will and resources  for operating  effective  programmes  not 
only in many  developing  countries  but also in some  industrialized  countries; 
Concerned  over the fact that inadequately  managed  tuberculosis  programmes  and especially  incomplete 
treatment  of tuberculosis  may lead to the development  of dangerous  drug-resistant  forms  of tuberculosis,  and 
that there  is still inadequate  appreciation  of the seriousness  of the situation, 
1. THANKS  the Director-General  for his report; 
2. WELCOMES  the progress  achieved  during  the past two years  in meeting  the needs  of Member  States,  in 
particular: 
(1) the  setting-up  of a coordination,  advisory  and review  group  involving  representatives  of Member 
States,  donors  and the scientific  community  in guidance  of the programme; 
(2) the  development  of cost-effective  tuberculosis  programme  management  strategies,  effective  tools  to 
implement  the strategies，and  training  materials; 
3. URGES  Member  States  to take rapid  action  to strengthen  national  tuberculosis  programmes,  as part of 
their national  health  services  and as an integral  part of primary  health  care,  within  the framework  of WHO，s 
global  tuberculosis  strategy,  the main  components  of which  are: 
(1) detection  of smear-positive  cases  through  reliable  microscopic  examinations; 
(2) introduction  of standardized  short-course  chemotherapy  with particular  emphasis  on directly 
observed  therapy  during  the initial  two months;

(3) introduction  of standardized  case registries  and thorough  evaluation  of treatment  results  by cohort 
analysis; 
(4) provision  of regular  and uninterrupted  supplies  of antituberculosis  drugs  of assured  quality  to all 
treatment  centres  with particular  emphasis  on coordinating  supply,  storage  and distribution,  so that drugs 
are used appropriately,  preferably  being  only accessible  through  national  control  programmes  where  they 
exist; 
(5) promotion  of public  awareness  on the prevention  of tuberculosis,  the recent  increase  in its 
incidence  and its relation  with HIV,  through  appropriate  channels  including  schools  and the media; 
4. URGES  the international  community,  including  bilateral,  multilateral  and nongovernmental 
organizations,  to continue  their collaboration  and support  for improved  tuberculosis  programmes  at national, 
regional  and global  levels; 
5. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to ensure  that the WHO  tuberculosis  strategy  is effectively  supported  and implemented  at all levels 
of the Organization  by further  strengthening  the capacity  of the programme,  and to reinforce  WHO's 
support  to Member  States  in the effective  implementation  of their national  tuberculosis  programmes; 
(2) to ensure  coordinated  efforts  to fight tuberculosis  with other  relevant  programmes,  especially  the 
Drug Action  Programme,  the Global  Programme  on AIDS  and programmes  on primary  health  care 
including  district  health  systems,  in order  to use limited  resources  optimally; 
(3) to advocate  vigorously  that the responsible  authorities  in Member  States  and the international 
community  concentrate  available  resources  on the urgent  task of controlling  tuberculosis; 
(4) to mobilize  additional  resources  in order  to accelerate  and expand  cooperation  with Member  States 
for tuberculosis  control  and to consider  establishing  a Special  Account  for Tuberculosis  in the Voluntary 
Fund for Health  Promotion; 
(5) to keep the Executive  Board  and the Health  Assembly  informed  of progress  in implementing  this 
resolution.
