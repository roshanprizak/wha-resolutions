VVHA21.1 Twentieth  Anniversary  of the  World  Health  Organization 
The Twenty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  devoted  the  second  day  of its session  to celebrating  the  twentieth  anniversary  of the  World 
Health  Organization; 
Having  taken  this  opportunity  to cast  a backward  glance  and  measure  the  distance  covered  since  7 April 
1948,  when  the  Constitution  came  into  force; 
Finding  grounds  for  justifiable  pride  in the  results  so far achieved  and  in the progress  made  by the Organization  with  the  close  collaboration  of the  United  Nations,  the  specialized  agencies  and  intergovernmental 
and non-governmental  organizations  towards  the  attainment  of the objective  assigned  to it by its Constitution; 
and 
Being  nevertheless  deeply  conscious  of the  tasks  that  still  remain  to be accomplished  by the Organization 
and of its responsibilities  for  ensuring  the  attainment  of the  highest  possible  level  of health  by all peoples, 
particularly  those  who  in that  regard  remain  the  least  privileged, 
1. APPEALS  to Members  and  Associate  Members  to continue  giving  the  Organization  the  moral  and  material 
support  they  have  hitherto  so wholeheartedly  accorded  it; 
2. EXPRESSES  to all those  organizations  which  have  collaborated  with  the  World  Health  Organization  its 
profound  appreciation  and  its confidence  that  they  will  continue  to give  in the  future  the support  they  have  so 
unstintingly  given  in the  past; 
3. RECOGNIZES  the  inestimable  debt  it owes  to all those  who,  since  the  very  beginnings  of the  Organization, 
have  given  of their  best  as members  of the  Technical  Preparatory  Committee,  the  Interim  Commission,  the 
Health  Assembly,  the  Executive  Board  and  the  regional  committees,  and  as collaborating  experts  or as 
members  of the  Secretariat;  and 
4. REAFFIRMS  the  World  Health  Organization's  determination,  in the  spirit  of its Constitution  and  with  the 
help  of all those  who  share  its ideals,  to move  steadily  towards  the  attainment  of its objective  during  the  third 
decade  now  opening  before  it.
