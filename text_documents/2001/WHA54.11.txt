WHO medicines strategy
The Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly,
Recalling resolutions, nominally WHA39.27, WHA41.16, WHA43.20, WHA45.27,
WHA47.12, WHA47.16, WHA47.17, WHA49.14 and WHA52.19;
Having considered the report on the revised drug strategy,1 and bearing in mind the previous
report on the subject,2 that highlight challenges related to international trade agreements, access to
essential drugs, drug quality and rational use of medicines, together with the urgent need to improve
access to drugs for treating priority health problems such as malaria, childhood illnesses, HIV/AIDS
and tuberculosis, among others;
Acknowledging the four main objectives of WHO’s medicines strategy, namely, to frame and
implement policy; to ensure access; to ensure quality, safety and efficacy; and to promote rational useof medicines;
Taking into account that the aforementioned health problems are particularly acute among poor
and vulnerable populations, entrapping them in poverty, and substantially inhibiting the growth of
national and international economies to the detriment of all humanity;
Recalling that the Constitution of the World Health Organization provides that the enjoyment of
the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without
distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition, and considering that
progressive realization of that right should involve access, on a non-discriminatory basis, to healthfacilities, prevention, care, treatment and support in the context of access to medicines;
Bearing in mind the WHO global framework for expanding access to essential drugs, and its
four components: the rational selection and use of medicines, reliable health and supply systems,
sustainable financing, and affordable prices;
Taking into account that access to medicines is particularly price sensitive, since most people in
developing countries have to pay personally for health care, and that the commitment of governments,

2organizations of the United Nations system, the private sector, and the civil society is necessary in
order to achieve universal access;1
Taking into account the urgency of implementing the WHO medicines strategy in order fully to

economic assistance channeled to implementation of the WHO medicines strategy;
Recognizing the importance of national drug policies established in accordance with WHO
guidelines;
Commending the strong leadership that WHO has shown in re-emphasizing the essential drugs
concept, and the contribution of nongovernmental organizations working in public health to attainingsuch objectives as the framing of national drug policies and related aspects;
Noting that the impact of international trade agreements on access to, or local manufacturing of,
essential drugs and on the development of new drugs needs to be further evaluated;
Recognizing that well-functioning and equitable health systems, including reliable supply
systems, are key elements in any framework for expanding access to essential drugs;
Noting resolution 2001/33 on access to medication in the context of pandemics such as
HIV/AIDS adopted by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights at its 57th session;

people, especially those who can least afford the costs, and recognizing the efforts of Member
