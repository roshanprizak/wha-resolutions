Considering also the need to make these international biological standards available to Member States in the most expeditious and convenient manner, as a contribution towards enabling an acceptable level of quality of biological substances used in medicine tobe achieved and Recognizing the value and utility to Member States of these international units, aswell as of international units defined fora number of international reference preparations of biological substances, in the national control of biological products, 1. AUTHORIZES the Director-General, where necessary for the use of regulatory agencies of Member States, to make additions to or replacements of these international biological preparations, subject in each case to the satisfactory completion of the technical procedures now established of international collaborative studies and assays and under the advice of the members of the Expert Advisory Panel on Biological Standardization or other experts designated to deal with the standardization of particular biological substances 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to inform Member States periodically when such international biological preparations are established and their international units have been defined and 3. INVITES the Director-General to inquire periodically of Members regarding the use being made of these international standards and other biological preparations in their countries in the control of biological products.
