MATURITY  BEFORE CHILDBEARING  AND PROMOTION 
OF RESPONSIBLE  PARENTHOOD 
The Thirty-eighth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA31.55  and WHA32.42  on the long-term  programme  on maternal  and 
child health; 
Recognizing  the disastrous  world-wide  health,  educational,  economic  and social 
consequences  of premature  pregnancy  in adolescent  women, and in particular  the high risks of 
maternal  morbidity  and mortality,  as well as low birth-weight,  with consequent  infant 
mortality  and physical  or mental handicap  which may persist  throughout  life； 
Recognizing  that these effects  are compounded  where poverty,  illiteracy,  adverse 
environmental  conditions  or undernutrition  prevail,  and where for many reasons  prenatal  care 
is not available  or sought; 
Aware that a large and increasing  proportion  of the populations  of many Member States is 
adolescent  and that, pending  the provision  of adequate  health services  for all, trained 
health workers  and resources  are limited,  especially  in rural areas； 
1. URGES  all Member States to act immediately； 
(1) to promote  healthy  families  through  the provision  of adequate  information  and 
guidance  for responsible  parenthood  to adolescents； 
(2) to promote  the delay of childbearing  until both prospective  parents,  but especially 
the mother,  have reached  maturity  in adulthood； 
(3) to ensure that their populations  are aware of the need for both prospective  parents 
to be fully grown, adequately  nourished,  and disease-free  before conception; 
(4) to ensure that health,  education  and social service  providers  are enabled  to 
provide sound, culturally  acceptable  information  and guidance;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General; 
(1) to encourage  collaborative  action-oriented  research  on both biomedical  and 
culturally  relevant  social factors  contributing  to the prevention  of pregnancy  before 
the couple are biologically  and socially  mature,  and on the adverse  consequences  of 
pregnancy  and childbearing  in adolescence； 
(2) to increase  the Organization1s  collaboration  with Member States and their relevant 
governmental  and nongovernmental  agencies  in providing  primary  health care with the 
emphasis  on promotive  and preventive  programmes  for adolescents  including  family life 
education,  antenatal,  delivery  and postnatal  care, and supporting  family services  as an 
urgent step in the implementation  of the 1978 Declaration  of Alma-Ata.
