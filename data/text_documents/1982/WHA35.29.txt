Gravely concerned  at the growing  number of refugees  in the African  continent,  which

Bearing in mind the heavy sacrifices  that the countries  of asylum are making,  despite 
their limited  resources,  to alleviate  the plight of those refugees; 
1. REITERATES  the need to give high priority  to the assistance  provided  to refugees  in 
Africa in the area of competence  of WHO; 
2. APPEALS  to Member States and to relevant  governmental  and nongovernmental  organizations 
to provide  needed assistance  to the countries  of asylum so as to enable them to strengthen 
their health capacity  and provide  the facilities  and services  essential  to the care and 
wellbeing  of the refugees; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to continue  and intensify  his close cooperation,  within his fields of competence, 
with the office of the UNHCR and other relevant  organizations  in the follow-up  and 
implementation  of the conclusions  of the International  Conference  on Assistance  to 
Refugees  in Africa; 
(2) to submit a comprehensive  report to the seventy-first  session  of the
