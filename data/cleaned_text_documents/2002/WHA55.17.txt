The Fifty-fifth World Health Assembly, Recalling resolution WHA46.31 and resolutions CD31.R26, CD33.R19 and CD43.R4 of the Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization on dengue prevention and control; Concerned that an estimated 50 million dengue infections occur annually and that the geographical spread, incidence, and severity of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever are increasing in the tropics; Recognizing the growing burden of disease, particularly among children, and the social and economic impact of dengue epidemics; Acknowledging the progress made in reducing the case-fatality rates of dengue haemorrhagic fever in some countries; Appreciating that significant advances have been made in the development of dengue vaccines, although they are not yet available for public health use; Recognizing that prevention or reduction of dengue viral transmission entirely depends on control of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti and, toa lesser extent, A. albopictus and other secondary vector species; Aware that dengue vector-control programmes have had considerable success in the past, but that sustained suppression of vector populati ons today largely depends on commitment of governments and community participation in both planning and intervention strategies and implementation of control measures to prevent breeding of A. aegypti ; Further acknowledging that, at the International Conference on Dengue and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (Chiang Mai, Thailand, 20-24 November 2000) , more than 700 public health specialists from 41 countries recommended that all countries at risk of dengue viral transmission should develop and implement sustainable prevention and control programmes, WHA55.17 2 1. URGES Member States: (1) to advocate increased commitment allocation of additional human and other resources for improved and sustained prevention and control efforts and for strengthened research; (2) to build and strengthen the capacity of health systems for management, surveillance, prevention, control and management of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever; (3) to strengthen the capacity of diagnostic la boratories, taking into account the fundamental importance of laboratory diagnosis to confirm etiology and to strengthen clinical and epidemiological surveillance for dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever; (4) to promote active intersectoral partnerships involving international, regional, national and local agencies, nongovernmental organizations, foundations, the private sector, community and civic organizations; (5) to pursue, encourage and support the devel opment, application, evaluation and research of new and improved tools and strategies for prevention and control of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever; (6) to strengthen health measures at borders for vector control and opportunities for diagnosis and treatment in order to optimize regional resources; 2. URGES other specialized agencies, bodies and programmes of the United Nations system, bilateral development agencies, nongovernmental organizations and other concerned groups to increase their cooperation in dengue fever prevention and control, through both continued support for general health and social development and specific support to national and international prevention and control programmes, including emergency control; 3. REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to develop further and support implementation of the global strategy for prevention and control of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever through integrated environmental management; (2) to continue to seek resources for advocacy and research on improved and new tools and methods for dengue fever prevention and control and their application; (3) to study the need for and feasibility of incorporating the surveillance and research of other arthropod-borne viral infections, such as Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, and other emerging diseases, in the surveillance system for dengue haemorrhagic fever; (4) to mobilize financial resources tobe spent on vector control and research into vaccines.
