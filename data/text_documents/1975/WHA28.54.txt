The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  the great  human  suffering  and  the financial  burden  caused  by blindness  and  the fact  that  a 
large  part  of such  blindness  could  be prevented  or cured; 
Taking  into  account  the  resolutions  on prevention  of blindness  adopted  by previous  World  Health 
Assemblies  (WHA22.29  and  WHA25.55)  and  the report  of the study  group  1 convened  by WHO  in 1972，as 
well as the adoption  of “Foresight  prevents  blindness"  as the theme  for World  Health  Day  in 1976;  and 
Recognizing  the  potential  contribution  of governmental  and  nongovernmental  organizations, 
1. EXPRESSES  its appreciation  of the work  already  undertaken  in this  connexion  by WHO,  especially  with 
regard  to some  major  causes  of blindness,  such  as onchocerciasis,  trachoma  and  others； 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to continue  these  efforts; 
(2) to encourage  Member  countries  to develop  national  programmes  for  the prevention  of blindness 
especially  aimed  at the  control  of trachoma,  xerophthalmia,  onchocerciasis  and  other  causes  and  to 
introduce  adequate  measures  for  the early  detection  and  treatment  of other  potentially  blinding  conditions  such  as cataract  and  glaucoma  ； 
(3) to encourage  national  and  international  nongovernmental  organizations  to mobilize  financial  and 
other  resources  for the implementation  of this  programme  ； and 
(4) to report  to the  World  Health  Assembly  on developments  in the control  of blindness  in general 
and of onchocerciasis,  trachoma  and  xerophthalmia  in particular.
