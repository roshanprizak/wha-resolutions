WHA28.83  The  need  for laboratory  animals  for the control  of biological  products  and  the establishment  of 
breeding  colonies 
The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Taking  into  account  the  increasing  use  of experimental  animals,  particularly  nonhuman  primates 
(simians)  in biomedical  research,  in vaccine  production  and  in the safety  controls  for therapeutic  substances 
in current  use,  pending  the development  of better  alternative  methods; 
Recognizing  instances  where  the  inappropriate  use  of simians  has  led to the  severe  limitation  of the 
supply  of simians  for legitimate  scientific  purposes, 
1. URGES  Member  States: 
(1) to review  the practices  of research  institutions  and  pharmaceutical  concerns  in their  use of simians; 
(2) to establish  guidelines  for the use of simians  to ensure  their  economic  use; 
(3) to request  their  health  administrations  to explain  to other  branches  of government  the significance 
to human  health  of the use  of simians; 
(4) to cooperate  with  other  States  in assuring  the immediate  and  long-term  availability  of simians  for 
legitimate  health  needs; 
(5) where  appropriate  to make  available  the simians  necessary  for the establishment  of breeding  colonies  ； 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to assist  in developing  international  guidelines  for the use of simians  in human  health  programmes  ； 
(2) to advise  on methods  of limiting  the unnecessary  international  trade  in simians,  which  frequently 
carry  unsuspected  diseases  dangerous  to humans  ； and 
(3) to review  the situation  and  report  to the Twenty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly.
