commending the heroic efforts of the front -line health workers, Government, people and civil and 
religious leaders of Pakistan for their strengthened commitment to polio eradication, as evidenced by 
efforts to implement the low -transmission season plan for the first half of 2015, while faced with 
unique challenges;  
Recalling Unite d Nations General Assembly resolution 69/132 on global health and foreign 
policy, which “urges full respect for the rules and principles of international humanitarian law … [and]

urges States to develop effective measures to prevent and address violence against such personnel”;  
Recognizing the conclusions of the meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on 
immunization (Geneva, 21 –23 October 2014) th at preparations are on track for the global withdrawal 
of the type 2 component in oral poliovirus vaccine in April 2016; and, noting the progress achieved in

2 1. URGES Member States with poliovirus transmission:  
(1) to stop all wild poliovirus transmission by fully implementing all strategic approaches 
outlined in the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013 –2018 and nationa l 
emergency action plans;  
(2) to ensure that all necessary measures are in place for the safe access of health workers to 
all communities and ensure the safety of health workers, including through the appropriate 
engagement with and support of community leaders and relevant law -enforcement, military, 
non-military and non -State entities;  
(3) to implement fully the temporary recommendations under the International Health 
Regulations (2005) in order to reduce the risk of international spread of wild poliovir us; 
(4) to intensify cross -border collaboration for improving both vaccination and surveillance 
activities;  
2. URGES all Member States that currently use oral poliovirus vaccine to prepare for the global 
withdrawal of the type 2 component of the oral polio virus vaccine in April 2016, including by:  
(1) developing national plans, by end -September 2015, for the withdrawal of the type  2 
component of oral poliovirus vaccine and its replacement with the bivalent oral poliovirus 
vaccine;  
(2) expediting the registr ation of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine for use in routine 
immunization programmes and, if required and in the interim, authorizing its use on the basis of 
prequalification granted by WHO;  
(3) implementing national policy for the appropriate destruction of residual trivalent vaccine 
stocks;  
(4) completing the introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine optimally before the 
withdrawal of the type 2 component of oral poliovirus vaccine in April 2016;  
3. URGES all Member States:1 
(1) to achieve and mainta in certification -standard surveillance to detect polioviruses, and to 
respond fully to polioviruses detected from any source;2 to immediately put in place national 
public health emergency measures, as appropriate, to respond to a new polio outbreak in a 
polio-free country following confirmation of detection of any circulating wild poliovirus, type  2 
circulating vaccine -derived poliovirus or Sabin poliovirus following withdrawal of the type  2 
component in the oral poliovirus vaccine; and by ensuring full imp lementation of revised 
                                                      
1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations.  
2 For example, any positive sample from a case of acute flaccid paralysis or its contacts, environmental surveillance, 
and targeted stool surveys.    WHA6 8.3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  3 outbreak response protocols1 that build on the international outbreak response guidelines issued 
in resolution WHA59.1;  
(2) to support the global expansion of environmental surveillance in strategically -selected 
high-risk locations t o supplement acute flaccid paralysis surveillance for prompt detection of 
polioviruses;  
(3) to support those Member States experiencing poliovirus transmission in their eradication 
efforts, including through political engagement and the provision of additi onal support as 
appropriate;  
(4) to monitor for potential gaps in population immunity and implement measures to fill such 
gaps and further boost population immunity through timely and complete routine immunization 
and, where necessary, high -quality supplem entary immunization activities;  
(5) to make available urgently the financial resources required for the full and continued 
implementation of the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013 –2018, including 
through the rapid and full operationalization  of pledged funds and the filling of the remaining 
funding gap;  
(6) to lead the development of national plans to ensure that polio assets, lessons learnt and 
knowledge acquired are applied to support other national health priorities, notably to routine 
immunization, and ensure that the potential legacy of polio eradication is fully realized;  
(7) to implement appropriate containment of type 2 wild polioviruses in essential facilities by 
the end of 2015 and of type 2 Sabin poliovirus within three months of gl obal withdrawal of the 
type 2 component in oral poliovirus vaccine in April 2016;2 
(8) to establish procedures to authorize the importing and use of monovalent oral poliovirus 
vaccine type 2 from the global stockpile after its release has been authorized b y the 
Director -General in the event of an emergency; whereas the Strategic Advisory Group of 
Experts on immunization has advised to maintain only a global stockpile of monovalent oral 
poliovirus vaccine type 2, Member States that decide to establish a nati onal stockpile of this 
vaccine should maintain the stockpile in conditions of containment that are verified by the 
Regional Certification Commission for Polio Eradication to be compliant with the containment 
Global Action Plan,2 and seek authorization of the Director -General of WHO before its release 
and use;  
4. REQUESTS the Director -General:

inactivated poliovirus vaccine for use in all countries introducing the vaccine in their routine 
immunization schedules;  
(3) to ensure that prequalification of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine for use in routine 
immunization programmes is done expeditiously i n order to support its introduction by Member 
States;
