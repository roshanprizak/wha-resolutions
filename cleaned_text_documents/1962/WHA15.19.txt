The Fifteenth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Director-General on the development of the malaria eradication programme;1 Noting the satisfactory progress being made, with large areas in the advanced programmes entering the consolidation phase or approaching the achievement of eradication; Noting further that newly developing countries are embarking on pre-eradication programmes; Recognizing that, while it is normally necessary fora malaria eradication programme tobe implemented by a specialized service, the active participation of the health service assumes considerable importance as the programme progresses towards its goal, becoming fundamental in the maintenance phase when vigilance against the re-establishment of the infection becomes the responsibility of health services, 1. URGES governments with malaria eradication programmes in operation to ensure active participation of the health service, particularly in the epidemiological activities ; 2. URGES countries which have areas in the consolidation phase, and are therefore approaching the maintenance phase, to ensure that the health services are being adequately prepared to assume vigilance responsibilities during this phase; and 3. RECOMMENDS that countries which are embarking upon pre-eradication programmes plan the development of their health services with a view to building up abasic infrastructure in the malarious areas to make possible the implementation of a malaria eradication programme.
