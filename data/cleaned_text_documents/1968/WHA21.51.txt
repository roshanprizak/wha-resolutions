The Twenty-first World Health Assembly, Having considered the recommendation contained in the fourteenth report of the Committee on international Quarantine 1 concerning the vapour disinsection system for aircraft; Having noted the conclusions of the Expert Committee on Insecticides in its eleventh 2 and sixteenth reports that, on the one hand, a vapour disinsection system is automatic, practical and, being performed in flight, does not involve any operational delay and that, on the other hand, the utilization of dichlorvos 4 in such a system is, in the dosages proposed, effective and safe for passengers and crew; Recognizing that the ever-increasing international air traffic greatly enlarges the risk of the introduction of disease vectors into new areas; and Recognizing that the present " blocks away " aircraft disinsection method has not been fully effective and practicable in large aircraft, 1. RECOMMENDS to Member States: (1) that for disinsecting aircraft in international passenger and freight traffic the methods approved by WHO shall be used, these being as follows: (i) for pressurized aircraft: (a) the vapour disinsecting system for in-flight disinsection, or (b) aerosol disinsection on the ground on arrival; (ii) for non-pressurized aircraft: (a) " blocks away " aerosol disinsection, or (b) aerosol disinsection on the ground on arrival; (2) that the vapour disinsection system and aerosol disinsection formulation approved by WHO shall be used; and (3) that the effective date for the recommendations for vapour disinsection shall be 31 December 1970; and 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to publish the specifications for the approved vapour disinsection system. Handb.
