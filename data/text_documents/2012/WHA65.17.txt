Agenda item 13.12 26 May 2012 
Global vaccine action plan 
 
The Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on the draft global va ccine action plan; 1 
Recognizing the importance of immunization as one o f the most cost-effective interventions in 
public health, which should be recognized as a core  component of the human right to health; 
Acknowledging the remarkable progress made in immun ization in several countries to ensure 
that every eligible individual is immunized with al l appropriate vaccines, irrespective of geographica l 
location, age, gender, disability, educational leve l, socioeconomic level, ethnic group or work 
condition; 
Applauding the contribution of successful immunizat ion programmes in achieving global health 
goals, in particular in reducing childhood mortalit y and morbidity, and their potential for reducing 
mortality and morbidity across the life-course; 
Noting that the introduction of new vaccines target ed against several important causes of major 
killer diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and ce rvical cancer can be used as a catalyst to scale up  
complementary interventions and create synergies be tween primary health care programmes; and that 
beyond the mortality gains, these new vaccines will  prevent morbidity with resulting economic returns 
even in countries that have already succeeded in re ducing mortality; 
Concerned that, despite the progress already made, disease eradication and elimination goals 
such as the eradication of poliomyelitis, the elimi nation of measles, rubella, and maternal and neonat al 
tetanus cannot be met without achieving and sustain ing high and equitable coverage; 
Concerned that low-income and middle-income countri es where the adoption of available 
vaccines has been slower may not have the opportuni ty to access newer and improved vaccines 
expected to become available during this decade; 
Alarmed that globally routine immunization services  are not reaching one child in five, and that 
substantial gaps persist in routine immunization co verage within countries; 
Recalling resolutions WHA58.15 and WHA61.15 on the global immunization strategy,
