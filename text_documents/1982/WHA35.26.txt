THIRTY-FIFTH  WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA35.26 
14 May 1982 
INTERNATIONAL  CODE OF MARKETING  OF BREAST-MILK  SUBSTITUTES 
The Thirty-fifth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  WHA33 .32 on Infant and Young Child Feeding  and resolution  WHA34.22 
adopting  the International  Code of Marketing  of Breast-Milk  Substitutes  ； 
Conscious  that breast-feeding  is the ideal method of infant feeding  and should be 
promoted  and protected  in all countries； 
Concerned  that inappropriate  feeding  practices  of infants  result in greater  incidence  of 
infant mortality,  malnutrition  and disease,  especially  in conditions  of poverty  and lack of 
hygiene； 
Recognizing  that commercial  marketing  of breast-milk  substitutes  for infants  has 
contributed  to an increase  in artificial  feeding； 
Recalling  that the Thirty-fourth  World Health Assembly  adopted  an International  Code 
intended  to，inter  alia, deal with these marketing  practices  ； 
Noting that while many Member States have taken some measures  related  to improving  infant 
and young child feeding,  few Member States have adopted  and adhered  to the International  Code 
as a "minimum  requirement"  and implemented  it nin its entirety"  , as called for in resolution 
WHA34.22; 
URGES Member States to give renewed  attention  to the need to adopt national  legislation, 
regulations  or other suitable  measures  to give effect to the International  Code; 
REQUESTS  the Director-General 
(a) to design and coordinate  a comprehensive  programme  of action to support  Member States 
in their efforts  to implement  and monitor  the Code and its effectiveness； 
(b) to provide  support  and guidance  to Member States as and when requested  to ensure that 
the measures  they adopt are consistent  with the letter and spirit of the International 
Code; 
(c) to undertake,  in collaboration  with Member States,  prospective  surveys,  including 
statistical  data of infant and young child feeding  practices  in the various  countries, 
particularly  with regard to the incidence  and duration  of breast-feeding. 世界衛生大會决議  ^一⑶
