FIFTY-SECOND WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA52.24
Agenda item 13 25 May 1999
Prevention and control of iodine
deficiency disorders
The Fifty-second World Health Assembly,
Having  considered the report on progress achieved in preventing and controlling iodine deficienc y
disorders;
Recalling  resolutions WHA39.31, WHA43.2 and WHA49.13 on the prevention and control of iodin e
deficiency disorders;
Concerned  that iodine deficiency remains a major threat to the health and development of population s
worldwide  and that it may result in goitre, stillbirth and miscarriage, neonatal and juvenile thyroid deficiency ,
dwarfism,  brain damage and intellectual impairment, deaf mutism, spastic weakness and paralysis, as well a s
lesser degrees of loss of physical and mental function;
Recognizing that the elimination of iodine deficiency will therefore represent a major public health triumph
of truly global proportions and an important contribution to national economic development,
1. COMMENDS:
(1) governments, international organ izations, bilateral agencies and nongovernmental organizations, in
particular  the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, on their support in th e
struggle  to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders throughout the world, and on the progress to which they
have  contributed over the last decade to prevent and control iodine deficiency at global, regional an d
national levels;
(2) the salt industry for its collab oration and key role in making iodized salt available to populations at
risk of iodine deficiency, and f or its initiative in highlighting iodization of salt at the 8th International Salt
Symposium at The Hague in May 2000;
2. REAFFIRMS the goal of eliminating iodine deficiency disorders as a major public health problem, while
recognizing  that some countries still face considerable obstacles in meeting this goal and consequently require
additional intensive support;WHA52.24
23. URGES Member States:
(1) to assess the extent and severity of iodine deficien cy disorders, where they have not already done so;
(2) to redouble their efforts to promote universal salt iodization, including the adoption of relevan t
legislation, and t o implement alternative strategies for iodine supplementation in areas where iodized salt
is not yet available;
(3) to monitor the iodine status of their population s and the quality of iodized salt in all areas, including
those where current iodine intakes are thought to be adequat e, in order to gauge progress towards achieving
the goal of sustainable elimination of iodine deficiency disorders as a public health problem;
(4) to collabor ate in the process of verification that the goal of sustainable elimination of iodin e
deficiency disorders as a public health problem has been achieved;
4. REQUESTS the Director-General:
(1) to provide, on request, technical support to Member States in formulating and implementin g
programmes for the control of iodine defi ciency, including the development of appropriate communication
strategies, and the promotion of effective programme implementation;
(2) to mobilize, and collaborate with, international and bilateral deve lopment agencies, nongovernmental
organizations and the private sector in support of the effici ent and effective iodization of salt by both largeand small-scale salt producers being cognizant of their particular characteristics;
(3) to consider the elimi nation of iodine deficiency disorders as a priority programme for WHO and to
provide technical support to Member States in establishing and strengthening systems for monitoring the
iodine  status of their populations and the quality of iodized salt, to identify the required financial an d
technical  resources for this purpose, and to support Member States in developing links with the sal t
industry;
(4) to facilitate intercountry cooperation and collaboration for sustainable elimination of iodin e
deficiency  disorders, in particular by developing and supporting subregional networks of laboratories to
ensure adequate surveillance and monitoring of these disorders;
(5) to main tain and update the WHO global database on the prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders
as a means of monitoring the status of  control programmes, assessing progress towards eliminating iodine
deficiency disorders, and increasing awareness of their public health implications;
(6) to report to the Health Assembly by 2005 on progress achieved in eliminating iodine deficienc y
disorders.
