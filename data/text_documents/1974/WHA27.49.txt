WHA27.49 WHO's  human  health  and  environment  programme 
The Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on WHO's  human  health  and  environment  programme  ； 
Aware  that  biological  pollution  of the environment  caused  by the lack  of basic  sanitary  measures,  par-ticularly  of adequate  water  supplies  and  waste  disposal  facilities,  is the most  prevalent  environmental  problem in the developing  countries,  while  physical  and  chemical  pollution  is of concern  not  only  in industrialized countries  but increasingly  also  in many  developing  countries  ； 
Emphasizing  that  any  environmental  deterioration  ultimately  affects  human  health  and  that  any  programme  for the improvement  of the environment  ultimately  contributes  to the improvement  of human  health 
and wellbeing; 
Believing  that  lack  of coordination  at the national  level  often  prevents  environmental  health  activities from  becoming  part  of balanced  public  health  programmes  ； 
Recognizing  the need  for a methodology  for the formulation  of the environmental  health  requirements of technological,  scientific  and socioeconomic  development  and  for their  application  in the planning  of appro-priate  programmes, 
1. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  States  : 
(1) make  the immediate  and  long-term  protection  and  promotion  of human  health  and  wellbeing  the 
basis  for their  formulation  of environmental  policy  and  environmental  programmes  and  projects  ； 
(2) make  health-oriented  environmental  action  an essential  part  of all relevant  major  national  pro-grammes  for social  and  economic  development; 
(3) strengthen  environmental  health  functions,  manpower  and  services  in health  and  other  agencies; 
(4) collaborate  with  WHO  in the establishment  of environmental  health  criteria  and  monitoring,  and in the exchange  of information  on the prevention  of health  risks  resulting  from  the environment,  par-ticularly  in relation  to pollution  control  and  the adaptation  of methods  for basic  sanitary  measures  to suit local  resources; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to continue  to implement  resolutions  WHA24.47  and  WHA26.58  on the basis  of the principles  set 
forth  in his report  ； 
(2) to continue  to provide  assistance  to Member  States,  to prepare  guides,  codes  of practice  and  technical  manuals,  to develop  and  adapt  methodology,  to promote  and  coordinate  research,  and  to collect, 
assess  and  disseminate  scientific  and other  relevant  information  ； 
(3) to emphasize  a comprehensive  approach  to environmental  health  problems  by integrating  programme 
activities  aiming  at improving  basic  sanitation,  the quality  of air, water  and  food,  conditions  of work, 
housing,  and  urbanization,  giving  priority  to those  conditions  that  are known  to have  an adverse  effect 
on community  health  and  the health  of groups  at special  risk; 
(4) to continue  to study  the environmental  health  needs  of Member  States  and  to review  and  update, 
as appropriate,  the WHO  long-term  programme  in environmental  health  at all levels  of the Organization 
to meet  these  needs  ； 
(5) to formulate  programmes  of collaboration  between  Member  States  and  the Organization  for systematically  collecting,  assessing,  disseminating  and  using  scientific  and  other  relevant  information,  and 
to invite  Member  States  to participate  with  WHO  in such  programmes,  particularly  those  related  to 
environmental  health  criteria,  environment  and  health  monitoring,  and  the adaptation  of suitable  methods 
for basic  sanitation  and  pollution  control  ； 
(6) to emphasize  the training  of multidisciplinary  manpower  for  environmental  health  programmes; 
(7) to submit  to the fifty-seventh  session  of the Executive  Board  and  to the Twenty-ninth  World  Health 
Assembly,  for their  review,  a report  containing  a summary  of progress  achieved  in the implementation 
of the Organization's  human  health  and  environment  programme,  and  proposals  for the future  development  of this  programme.
