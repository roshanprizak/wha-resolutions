The Third World Health Assembly, After having reviewed, in the light of the WHO Constitution and of the International Sanitary Conventions in force, the legal aspects of the question of emergency measures to prevent the introduction of cholera into the Hedjaz from countries in which the disease is endemic ; Whereas the 1926 Convention (Article 57) and the 1933 Convention for Aerial Navigation (Article 58) permit modification of their provisions by means of special agreements among Contracting Parties, the former only permitting measures less burdensome than those prescribed therein, the latter, although not so restrictive, providing that such agreements be " on the basis of the principles " of that Convention ; and Whereas if an emergency existed, it would be proper for the Director-General to convene an extraordinary meeting of the Section on Quarantine of the Expert Committee on International Epidemiology and Quarantine to advise on the measures tobe taken to meet the situation, and at present there is no emergency and only a possible danger of a later emergency (September 1950), 1. AGREES (1) that it would be inexpedient to refer the matter to the Executive Board ; (2) in view of the position stated in the penultimate paragraph of the preamble above, that the most suitable course to follow would be for an official approach tobe made by the Egyptian Government to the other governments concerned, namely India and Pakistan, stating the measures which, in the opinion of the Egyptian Government, it would be desirable for them to adopt before the commencement of the next pilgrimage season, any agreement reached between these governments tobe communicated to WHO ; and, further, 2. CONSIDERS that as the adoption by the present Assembly of interim emergency regulations on the pilgrimage would entail considerable administrative difficulties and as these regulations would, in order to become operative, require the consent of the countries concerned, there would beno advantage in following such a coarse in preference to that suggested above, namely, the voluntary adoption by these countries of special national legislation. , _ ( Seventh report oj the Committee on Programme, adopted at seventh plenary meeting, 25 May 1950) [A3 / R / 115]
