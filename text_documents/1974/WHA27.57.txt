WHA27.57 WHO  expanded  programme  on immunization 
The Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  statement  on immunization  against  the  childhood  diseases  and  the allocation 
of funds  for an integrated  programme  on immunization  contained  in the proposed  programme  and  budget 
estimates  for 1975;1 
Recognizing  the immense  contribution  immunization  has  made  to the control  of many  of the common 
communicable  diseases  in the countries  where  it has been  effectively  applied; 
Noting  that  in extensive  regions  of the world  immunization  is available  for only  a small  proportion  of 
children  in the susceptible  age-groups  ； 
Aware  of the potential  for disease  control  when  a well-planned  and  well-coordinated  programme  is 
instituted  ； 
Reaffirming  the importance  of systematic  immunization  programmes  in all countries;  and 
Expressing  its satisfaction  at the readiness  of the World  Health  Organization  to further  promote  measures 
to assist  countries  in extending  their  immunization  programmes  to cover  the greatest  possible  percentage  of 
the susceptible  populations, 
1. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  States  develop  or maintain  immunization  and  surveillance  programmes 
against  some  or all of the following  diseases  : diphtheria,  pertussis,  tetanus,  measles,  poliomyelitis,  tuberculosis, 
smallpox,  and others,  where  applicable,  according  to the epidemiological  situation  in their  respective  countries  ； 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General 
(1) to intensify  at all levels  of the Organization  its activities  pertaining  to the development  of immunization  programmes,  especially  for the developing  countries  ； 
(2) to assist  Member  States  (i) in developing  suitable  programmes  by providing  technical  advice  on 
the use of vaccines  and  (ii) in assuring  the availability  of good-quality  vaccines  at reasonable  cost; 
(3) to study  the possibilities  of providing  from  international  sources  and  agencies  an increased  supply 
of vaccines,  equipment  and  transport  and  developing  local  competence  to produce  vaccines  at the national 
level; 
(4) to continue  to support  research  on the efficacy  of vaccines  and  on as yet unsolved  practical  problems 
encountered  in immunization  procedures  ； 
(5) to arrange  seminars  and  other  educational  activities  on the design  and  execution  of programmes  ； 
and 
3. FURTHER  REQUESTS  the Director-General 
(1) to establish  a special  account  under  the Voluntary  Fund  for Health  Promotion  to be credited  with 
the value  of gifts  intended  for the expanded  programme  on immunization  and  to ensure  that  vaccines 
donated  to the programme  conform  with  the relevant  WHO  requirements; 
(2) to report  progress  annually  to the World  Health  Assembly.
