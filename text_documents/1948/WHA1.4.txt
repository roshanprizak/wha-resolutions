Resolution  4 
Regarding  the  Preparation  of a List  adapted  to 
the Problems  of Fœto-ïnfantile  Morbidity  and 
Mortality 
WHEREAS  the  Intermediate  List  of 150  causes 
does  not  properly  cover  the  diseases  affecting  the 
foetal  and  infantile  stages  of life,  since  it is too 
detailed  on  some  points  and  too  limited  with 
regard  to diseases  of infancy  : 
THE  CONFERENCE  RESOLVES  to  ask  the  World 
Health  Organization  to consider  the  desirability 
of a selective  list,  suitable  for  study  of fœtal  and 
infantile  morbidity  and  mortality.
