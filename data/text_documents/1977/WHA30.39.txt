WHA30.39 Système  international  d'Unités  : Use  of SI units  in medicine 
The Thirtieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General1  submitted  in  accordance  with  resolution 
WHA29.65; 
Noting  the wide  endorsement  that  has  been  given  by international  scientific  organizations  to the Système 
international  d'Unités  (SI)  developed  by the Conférence  générale  des Poids  et Mesures,  the intergovernmental 
body  responsible  for units  of measurement; 
Noting  further  that  the  change  to the  use of SI units  in medicine  has  already  taken  place  or is now 
under  way  in several  countries; 
Mindful  nevertheless  of the confusion  that  can  arise  if new  units  of measurement  are introduced  without 
adequate  preparation  ； 
1. RECOMMENDS  the  adoption  of the  SI by the entire  scientific  community,  and  particularly  the  medical 
community  throughout  the world; 
2. RECOMMENDS  that,  to minimize  any  confusion  due  to the simultaneous  use  of more  than  one  system  of 
units,  the period  of transition  to the new  system  should  not be unduly  prolonged; 
3. RECOMMENDS  that,  in addition  to the scale  in kilopascals,  the millimetre  (or centimetre)  of mercury  and 
the centimetre  of water  be retained  for the time  being  on the scales  of instruments  for the measurement  of the 
pressure  of body  fluids,  pending  wider  adoption  of the use of the pascal  in other  fields; 
4. RECOMMENDS  that,  in making  the change,  institutions,  scientific  associations,  and  the like  secure  the best 
available  advice  and  information,  and  give  their  personnel  or members  a course  of intensive  instruction  in 
the theory  and  application  of the SI prior  to the time  when  the change  takes  effect; 
5. RECOMMENDS  that  all medical  schools,  and  schools  providing  training  in disciplines  related  to medicine, 
include  courses  on the theory  and  use of the SI in their  curricula; 
6. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to assist  the change  by preparing  a succinct,  simple,  and  authoritative 
account  of the SI that  could  be made  available  to Member  States,  medical  associations,  and  medical  journals.
