Agenda item 11.14 21 May 2010 
Chagas disease: control and elimination 
 
The Sixty-third World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on Chagas disease: control and elimination;1 
Recognizing that all transmission routes (namely by  vectors, transfusion, organ transplantation, 
and by vertical and oral routes) have to be t ackled, and that, in particular, domestic vectorial 
transmission in Latin America has to be eliminat ed, with the understanding that elimination means 
stable interruption of domestic transmission; 
Expressing its satisfaction at the considerable progress achieved by countries towards the goal 
of eliminating Chagas disease, as recommended in resolution WHA51.14; 
Underlining that 2009 marked  the centenary of the description of this disease by 
Dr Carlos Chagas; 
Recognizing the success achieved through the inte rgovernmental initiatives in Latin America, 
and acknowledging the progress made through vector-control strategies;  
Recognizing the increasing number of cases of Chagas disease in countries where the disease is  
not endemic; 
Taking into account the need for harmonizati on of diagnostic and treatment procedures; 
Recognizing the need for the provision of appropr iate medical care for people affected by 
Chagas disease; 
Underlining the need for more effective, safe and adequate  medicines, including paediatric 
formulations, and for better c overage and distribution of those currently available; 
Recalling resolution CD49.R19 adopted by the 49t h Directing Council of PAHO in 2009, which 
urges Members States to commit themselves to the elimination or the reduction of neglected diseases and other related poverty diseases, including Chagas disease, with the aim that disease no longer 
represents a public health problem;

2 Acknowledging the significant collaboration and support among Member States and the support 
of other partners and apprecia ting their continuous assistance, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to reinforce efforts to st rengthen and consolidate nationa l control programmes especially 
in areas where Chagas disease has re-emerged, in disease-endemi c and non-endemic countries 
and to establish them where there are none; 
(2) to establish mechanisms to ensure broa d coverage of adequa te control measures, 
including the promotion of decent and healthy living conditions, prevention and the integration 
of specific actions within health services based  on primary care, together with strengthening 
community participation; 
(3) to harmonize systems and strengthen capac ities for surveillance, data collection and 
analysis and dissemination of information; 
(4) to integrate the care of patients with acute  and chronic clinical forms of Chagas disease 
into primary health services; 
(5) to reinforce the provision of existing tr eatments in disease-endemic countries with the 
aim of making access universal; 
(6) to promote and encourage operational research on control of Chagas disease in order: 
(a) to interrupt transmission by domestic insect vectors through their control and 
elimination; 
(b) to promote the development of medi cines that are more suitable, safe and 
affordable; 
(c) to promote the development of a valid and accessible test of cure; 
(d) to reduce the risk of late complications of the infection; 
(e) to establish systems of early detection,  in particular for the detection of new 
infections, of congenital infections in ne wborns and the reactivation of the disease in 
immunocompromised patients; 
(f) to optimize blood transfusion safety and screening procedures in endemic countries 
and to consider implementa tion of appropriate screening procedures in countries where 
the disease is not endemic; 
(7) to strengthen and harmonize public health policies to reduce the burden of Chagas 
disease, particularly in countries where the disease is not endemic; 
(8) to promote the development of public health measures in disease-endemic and 
non-endemic countries, with special focus on ende mic areas, for the prevention of transmission 
through blood transfusion and organ transplantati on, early diagnosis of congenital transmission 
and management of cases;   WHA63.20 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  (9) to integrate, at the primary health-care le vel, diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease in 
patients in both acute and chronic phases of the disease; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to draw attention to the burden of Chag as disease and to the need to provide equitable 
access to medical services for the management and prevention of the disease; 
(2) to strengthen implementation of vector-cont rol activities in order to achieve interruption 
of domestic transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi  and to promote research to improve or develop 
new prevention strategies; 
(3) to promote in areas endemic for Chagas di sease action to detect infected donors at blood 
banks in order to integrate strategies for safe blood; 
(4) to provide support to the countries of the Americas in order to strengthen 
intergovernmental initiatives and the technical secret ariat of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau 
as a successful form of technical cooperation am ong countries, and to consider an initiative for 
the prevention and control of Chagas disease in non-endemic regions; 
(5) to collaborate with Member States and in tergovernmental initiatives with the aim of 
setting objectives and goals for the interruption of  transmission, particularly for domestic 
vectorial transmission in Latin American countries; 
(6) to support the mobilization of national and in ternational, public and private financial and 
human resources to ensure achievement of the goals; 
(7) to promote research related to preven tion, control and care of Chagas disease; 
(8) to promote intersectoral efforts and co llaboration, and facilita te networking between 
organizations and partners interested in s upporting the development and the strengthening of 
Chagas disease-control programmes; 
(9) to report on progress in the elimination of Ch agas disease to the Sixty-fifth World Health 
Assembly through the Executive Board.
