WHA24.50  Co-ordination  with  the  United  Nations,  the  specialized  agencies  and  the  International  Atomic Energy  Agency  : Health  promotion  in relation  to disarmament 
The Twenty-fourth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  WHA  17.45  of March  1964,  in which  the  World  Health  Assembly  requested  the 
United  Nations  to urge  the  Conference  of the Eighteen-Nation  Committee  on Disarmament  to give  close 
and speedy  consideration  to the  proposals  submitted  to it recommending  the  application  of the  resources 
released  by way  of reductions  in military  budgets  in projects  aimed  at developing  economically  and  socially 
all countries  and  all regions  and  areas  markedly  affected  by poverty  and  by underdevelopment,  thus 
enabling  them  to attain  a state  of complete  physical,  mental  and  social  well-being; 
Recalling  further  Economic  and  Social  Council  resolution  1026  (XXXVII),  of 11 August  1964—on  the 
economic  and  social  consequences  of disarmament  and,  more  specifically,  on the  conversion  to peaceful 
needs  of the resources  released  by disarmament—which  welcomed  the  agreement  by the Secretary-General 
and the Directors-General  of the specialized  agencies  and  the International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  that  they 
would  co-operate  in the preparation  of all studies  of concerted  programmes  of work; 
Bearing  in mind  General  Assembly  resolution  2602  E (XXIV)  of 16 December  1969,  which  declared  the 
decade  of the  1970s  a Disarmament  Decade  and  which  recommended  that  consideration  be  given  to 
channelling  a substantial  part  of the resources  freed  by measures  in the field  of disarmament  to promote  the 
economic  development  of developing  countries  and,  in particular,  their  scientific  and  technological  progress, 
as well  as General  Assembly  resolution  2626  (XXV)  of 24 October  1970  on the International  Development 
Strategy  which  laid  down  that  there  should  be a close  link  between  the Second  United  Nations  Development 
Decade  and  the  Disarmament  Decade; 
Taking  note  of General  Assembly  resolution  2685  (XXV)  of 11 December  1970,  on the  economic 
and social  consequences  of disarmament,  which  requested  Member  States,  the specialized  agencies  and  the 
International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  as well  as other  organizations  in the United  Nations  family  to submit 
their  comments  and  recommendations  to the Secretary-General  so that  he, in consultation  with  a group  of 
experts,  could  prepare  a report  through  the Economic  and  Social  Council  to the General  Assembly  in 1973; 
Being  concerned  about  the  ever-spiralling  race  in armaments  and  the  considerable  investment  and 
utilization  of resources  in that  direction; 
Considering  the  many  development  projects  in health  which  cannot  be implemented  due  to lack  of 
resources; 
Noting  that  the next  general  programme  of work  of the World  Health  Organization  begins  in 1973,  when 
the Secretary-General  is to submit  his report  to the United  Nations  General  Assembly;  and 
Conscious  of the desirability  of stimulating  international  co-operation  in all those  activities  which  may 
assist  peace,  justice,  progress  and  prosperity  and  which  might  ensure  a more  stable  and  secure  world  so that 
the people  of all nations  may  live  in harmony, 
REQUESTS  the Director-General  to co-operate  with  the Secretary-General  of the United  Nations  in fulfilment  of the requests  set forth  in General  Assembly  resolution  2685  (XXV).
