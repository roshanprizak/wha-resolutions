The Thirteenth World Health Assembly, Recognizing that there are many instances where malaria eradication operations have produced, or are producing, collateral benefits in reducing the incidence of other vector-borne diseases; Believing that by advance planning it maybe possible for governments to take the maximum advantage of the favourable situation thus produced but without interfering with the normal development of their programme of malaria eradication, 1. INVITES all governments concerned to study the effects that their malaria eradication operations maybe having on the incidence of other vector-borne diseases of local importance and to consider the introduction of appropriate supplementary measures with a view to consolidating the advantages gained against such diseases so that positive and lasting achievements may result; and 2. RECOMMENDS to the Director-General to provide specialized staff and consultants to advise governments on this matter. Handb. Res., 5th ed., 1.5; 1.4.2 Eleventh plenary meeting, 19 May 1960 (fifth report of the Committee on Programme and Budget)
