WHA15.51  Role  of the Physician  in the Preservation  and  Promotion  of Peace 
The Fifteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  the  international  responsibilities  which  rest  upon  the  World  Health  Organization,  and 
being  aware  of the close  relationship  which  exists  between  health  and  the  preservation  of peace; 
Bearing  in mind  the stipulations  of the Preamble  to the Constitution  of the World  Health  Organization 
which  states,  inter  alia:  " The  health  of all peoples  is fundamental  to the attainment  of peace  and  security 
and is dependent  upon  the  fullest  co-operation  of individuals  and  States  "; 
Desiring  to emphasize  the close  relationship  which  exists  between  health—defined  as a state  of complete 
physical,  mental  and  social  well-being—and  the  happiness,  harmony  and  security  of all peoples; 
Considering  that  continuing  progress  in the improvement  of world  health  will  contribute  importantly 
to peace,  as well  as that  peace  is a basic  condition  for the preservation  and  improvement  of the health  of 
people  in the  whole  world, 
1. DECLARES  that  physicians  and  all other  medical  workers  have—in  the  exercise  of their  profession  and 
through  the relief  and  help  they  give  to their  patients—an  important  role  to play  in the preservation  and 
promotion  of peace,  by contributing  to the elimination  or at least  the attenuation  of the causes  of distress 
and dissatisfaction; 
2. CALLS  upon  all Members  to promote  the cause  of peace  by intensifying  their  efforts  to implement  the 
principles  and  purposes  embodied  in the Constitution  of the World  Health  Organization.
