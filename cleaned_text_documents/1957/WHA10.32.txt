The Tenth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Director-General2 on the implementation of resolutions WHA8.30 and WHA9.61 ; Having noted with satisfaction the ever-increasing number of countries and territories which have adopted malaria eradication as the objective of their antimalaria policy; Considering that, with the progress of malaria eradication programmes in some areas, it becomes more and more desirable that countries bordering on the eradication areas should also either carry out a programme of eradication, or at least cover with efficient control an adequate zone near the borders; Realizing that international implications of reimportation of malaria in countries which have eliminated or nearly eliminated the sources of the infection become a matter of concern, and that it is important that timely and adequate information be available to all governments concerned; Recognizing that malaria is one of the major obstacles to improving the standard of health throughout the world; 1. Considering that malaria eradication may not be implemented unless extraordinary financial assistance is available to many countries over a period of time ; Noting that the contributions received to date for the Malaria Eradication Special Account are inadequate to provide such financial assistance as is envisaged in resolutions WHA8.30 and WHA9.61, 1. BELIEVES that methods of fund-raising other than inviting contributions from governments should be explored and utilized; and 2. REQUESTS the Executive Board and the Director-General to take definite and specific steps with a view to obtaining contributions to the Malaria Eradication Special Account from all possible sources so as to enable the Organization to provide increased assistance towards achieving world-wide malaria eradication ; II. REQUESTS the Director-General : (1) to stimulate inter-country arrangements with a view to minimizing the danger of importation of sources of infection; and (2) to request all governments to supply information not less frequently than once a year as regards development of their malaria eradication or malaria control programme, so that up-to-date relevant data maybe centralized in WHO and circulated toother interested governments; III. Being aware of the necessity of developing research on problems which are or may become actual in malaria eradication, 1. INVITES governments to offer the collaboration of appropriate institutes for the investigations which would be indicated by expert opinion; and 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to stimulate and co-ordinate this research. Twelfth plenary meeting, 24 May 1957 (section 1 of the fourth report of the Committee on Programme and Budget)
