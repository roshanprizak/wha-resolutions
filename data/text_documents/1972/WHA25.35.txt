WHA25.35  Community  water  supply 
The Twenty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the  Director-General  on the  community  water  supply  programme; 
Noting  that  the  report  provides  new  information  on the  status  of community  water  supplies  and  the 
progress  achieved  in 90 developing  countries; 
Conscious  that  the  problem  of community  water  supplies  is inextricably  linked  with  the  problem  of 
waste-water  disposal; 
Recognizing  the  need  to accelerate  the  rate  of progress  in view  of the  continuing  high  prevalence  of 
waterborne  diseases, 
1. ENDORSES  the  revised  global  targets  proposed  by the  Director-General  for  community  water  supplies 
in the  developing  countries  to be attained  in the  Second  United  Nations  Development  Decade； 
2. DRAWS  ATTENTION  to the  special  needs  of the  rural  sector; 
3. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  States: 
(1) adopt  specific  national  targets  for the Second  United  Nations  Development  Decade  for both  urban 
and rural  water  supplies; 
(2) institute  the  systematic  collection  of information  relating  to community  water  supplies; 
(3) establish  the  appropriate  policies  and  infrastructure  and  allocate  the  financial  and  manpower 
resources  necessary  to achieve  these  targets; 
(4) take  such  steps  as would  lead  to increased  allocation  of resources  to rural  water  supplies; 
(5) provide  for  the  effective  surveillance  of drinking-water  quality  by competent  health  authorities 
and for  their  association  with  the  other  tasks  in this  field,  including  planning,  set  out  in resolution 
WHA21.36; 
(6) give  priority  to the  collection  and  disposal  of waste  water,  in satisfactory  hygienic  conditions, 
whenever  community  water  supply  programmes  are  instituted; 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to continue  to accord  high  priority  to technical  assistance  to Member 
States  in achieving  the  targets  proposed  for  the  Second  United  Nations  Development  Decade,  and  to: 
(1) prepare  guidelines,  manuals  and  codes  of practice  on the  planning,  design  and  management  of 
community  water  supply  and  sanitation  services,  with  emphasis  on the public  health  aspects  and  particular 
attention  to rural  areas  ； 
(2) intensify  the  research  and  development  efforts  of the  Organization  in the  light  of the  needs  and 
possibilities  of developing  countries; 
(3) continue  cooperation  with  other  international  and  bilateral  bodies,  including  UNICEF,  UNDP, 
IBRD  and  the  regional  development  banks,  with  a view  to increasing  assistance  to national  community 
water  supply  and  waste-water  disposal  programmes,  particularly  in the areas  of greatest  need,  and  helping 
governments  to make  effective  use  of such  assistance; 
(4) give  consideration  to the  related  problem  of waste-water  disposal; 
(5) keep  the  progress  made  under  periodic  review;  and 
(6) furnish  the World  Health  Assembly  with  a mid-decade  progress  report  covering  both  community 
water  supply  and  waste-water  disposal.
