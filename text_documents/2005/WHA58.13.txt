84 FIFTY-EIGHTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY 
 
   
 WHA58.13 Blood safety: proposal to establish World Blood Donor Day 
The Fifty-eighth World Health Assembly, 
Recalling resolution WHA28.72 which urged the development of national blood services based 
on the voluntary, nonremunerated donation of blood;  
Having considered the report on blood safety;1 
Alarmed by the chronic shortage of safe blood and blood products, particularly in low- and 
medium-income countries;  
Mindful that preventing the transmission of HIV and other bloodborne pathogens through 
unsafe blood and blood-product transfusions requires the collection of blood only from donors at the lowest risk of carrying such infectious agents;
 
Recognizing that voluntary, nonremunerated blood donation is the cornerstone of a safe and 
adequate national blood supply that meets the transfusion requirements of all patients;  
Noting the positive responses to World Blood Donor Day, 14 June 2004, for the promotion of 
voluntary, nonremunerated blood donation,  
1. AGREES to the establishment of an annual World Blood Donor Day, to be celebrated on 
14 June each year;  
2. RECOMMENDS that this blood donor day should be  an integral part of the national blooddonor recruitment programme; 
3. URGES Member States: 
(1) to promote and support the annual celebration of World Blood Donor Day;  
(2) to establish or strengthen systems for the recruitment and retention of voluntary, 
nonremunerated blood donors and the implementation of stringent criteria for donor selection;  
(3) to introduce legislation, where needed, to eliminate paid blood donation except in limited 
circumstances of medical necessity and, in such cases, to require informed assent of the transfusion recipient; 
(4) to provide adequate financing for high-quality blood donation services and for extension 
of such services to meet the needs of the patients;
 
(5) to promote multisectoral collaboration between government ministries, blood transfusion 
services, professional bodies, nongovernmental organizations, civil society and the media in the 
promotion of voluntary, nonremunerated blood donation;

 (6) to ensure the proper use of blood transfusion in clinical practice so as to avoid abuse of 
blood transfusion, which may result in a shortage of blood and hence stimulate the need for paid 
blood donation; 
(7) to support the full implementation of well-organized, nationally coordinated and 
sustainable blood programmes with appropriate regulatory systems through, in particular: 
(a) government commitment and support for a national blood programme with qualitymanagement systems, by means of a legal framework, a national blood-safety policy and 
plan, and adequate resources 
(b) organization, management and infrastructure to permit a sustainable blood 
transfusion service 
(c) equitable access to blood and blood products 
(d) voluntary, nonremunerated blood donors from low-risk populations 
(e) appropriate testing and processing of all donated blood and blood products  
(f) appropriate clinical use of blood and blood products; 
(8) to establish a quality process for policy- and decision-making for blood safety and 
availability based on ethical considerations, transparency, assessment of national needs, 
scientific evidence, and risk/benefit analysis; 
(9) to share information nationally and internationally in order to make clear the scientific, 
economic and social basis of national policy decisions related to blood safety and availability; 
(10) to strengthen partnerships at all levels in order to accomplish these recommended actions; 
4. CALLS UPON international organizations and bodies concerned with global blood safety to 
collaborate in promoting and supporting World Blood Donor Day; 
5. INVITES donor agencies to provide adequate funding for initiatives to promote voluntary, 
nonremunerated blood donation; 
6. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to work with other organizations of the United Nations system, multilateral and bilateral 
agencies, and nongovernmental organizatio ns to promote World Blood Donor Day; 
(2) to work with concerned organizations to provide support to Member States in 
strengthening their capacity to screen all donated blood against major infectious diseases in 
order to ensure that all blood collected and transfused is safe.
