WHA15.58  Organizational  Study:  Methods  of Planning  and  Execution  of Projects 
The Fifteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that  the expansion  in the activity  of the Organization  and  the new  tasks  arising  from  the 
increase  in its membership  and  the need  to intensify  assistance  to Member  States  make  it necessary  today, 
more  than  ever,  to try to find  the  methods  of work  which  ensure  the  greatest  effectiveness  for the least 
expenditure  of resources; 
Recognizing  that  a review  of the planning  methods  used  in the Organization  might  reveal  opportunities 
of making  more  effective  use of its resources, 
1. CONSIDERS  that  there  is a continuing  need  for  detailed  study  of methods  and  planning  and  of the 
effectiveness  of the  measures  taken  by the  Organization  in the  field;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  to make  its next  organizational  study  a review  of this  problem  through 
an investigation  of the  methods,  scope  and  quality  of execution  of projects,  and  the  effectivenes  of 
co-ordination  of WHO  activities  with  the  governments  of Member  States,  specialized  agencies  of the 
United  Nations  and  non-governmental  organizations  and  associations.
