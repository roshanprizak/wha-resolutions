Agenda  item 26.1 13  May 1992 
ASSESSMENT  OF NEW  MEMBERS  AND  ASSOCIATE  MEMBERS 
ASSESSMENTS  OF LATVIA  AND  LITHUANIA 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  that Latvia  and Lithuania,  both Members  of the United  Nations,  became  Members  of the World 
Health  Organization  by depositing  with the Secretary-General  of the United  Nations  formal  instruments  of 
acceptance  of the WHO  Constitution  on 4 December  1991  and 25 November  1991  respectively; 
Noting  that the United  Nations  General  Assembly  has not yet established  assessment  rates  for Latvia 
and Lithuania  but has decided  that,  when  determined，these  rates  will be deducted  from  the rates  applicable  to 
the former  USSR; 
Noting  that the contributions  payable  by Latvia  and Lithuania  in 1991  and 1992  would  in effect  constitute 
budgetary  income  since  they would  be deducted  from  contributions  payable  by the former  USSR,  responsibility 
for which  has been  assumed  by the Russian  Federation; 
Recalling  the principle  established  in resolution  WHA8.5,  and confirmed  in resolution  WHA24.12,  that 
the latest  available  United  Nations  scale  of assessments  should  be used as a basis  for determining  the scale  of 
assessments  to be used by WHO; 
Recalling  further  that the Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly,  in resolution  WHA26.21,  affirmed  its 
belief  that the scale  of assessments  in WHO  should  follow  as closely  as possible  that of the United  Nations, 
DECIDES: 
(1) that  Latvia  and Lithuania's  assessment  rates  for 1991  and 1992  in WHO  shall  be calculated  by the 
Director-General  on the basis  of the United  Nations  assessment  rates  determined  by the United  Nations 
General  Assembly; 
(2) that  Latvia  and Lithuania's  assessments  relating  to the year 1991  shall be reduced  to one-ninth  of 
the WHO  assessment  rates  calculated  in accordance  with operative  paragraph  (1) above; 
(3) that  Latvia  and Lithuania's  assessment  rates  and contributions  payable  shall  be deducted  from 
those  applicable  to the former  USSR,  responsibility  for payment  of which  has been  assumed  by the 
Russian  Federation; 
(4) that，notwithstanding  Financial  Regulation  7.1, the 1991  and 1992  contributions  of Latvia  and 
Lithuania  shall  be accounted  for as budgetary  income  upon  receipt.
