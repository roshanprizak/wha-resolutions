WHA3.81  Level  of Expenditure  for 1951 
The Third  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  that  the budget  for 1951  has been  established  at US $7,300,000,  and 
Recognizing  that  expenditure  should  not exceed  the funds  reasonably  expected  to be available  for the 
financial  year  1951, 
AUTHORIZES  the Executive  Board  at any  session  to establish  and  adjust  the expenditure  level  as it may consider  desirable  on the basis  of significant  changes  in the financial  position  of the Organization,  giving due consideration  to the administrative  problems  created  by fluctuations  in the authorized  level  of expenditure. 
(Fourth  report  of the  Committee  on  Administration, Finance  and  Legal  Matters,  adopted  at sixth  plenary meeting,  19 May  1950)  [A3/R/44]
