WHA28.70  WHO's  role  in the development  and  coordination  of biomedical  research 
The Twenty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the Director-General's  report  on WHO's  work  on the development  and  coordination 
of biomedical  research; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA23.59,  WHA25.60,  WHA26.42  and  WHA27.61  and  taking  into  account  the 
discussions  on this  subject  at the fifty-fifth  session  of the Executive  Board; 
Emphasizing  that  the solution  of the practical  public  health  problems  of all Member  countries  which 
WHO  is helping  to solve  largely  depends  upon  present  and  future  achievements  of biomedical  research, 
1. THANKS  the Director-General  for his report  and  for his efforts  to elaborate  A long-term  programme  for 
the development  and  coordination  of biomedical  research  with  a view  to enhancing  the scientific  and methodological  base  for  the  Organization's  activities  ； 
2. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to accelerate  work  on formulating  A comprehensive  long-term  WHO 
programme  for  the development  and  coordination  of biomedical  research  and  to pay  particular  attention 
to: 
(1) the  identification,  taking  into  account  the recommendations  of the Advisory  Committee  on Medical 
Research,  of a list of scientific  problems  whose  solution  is of particular  importance  for  the  Organization and  where  progress  is likely; 
(2) expanding  and  intensifying  the special  programme  for research  and  training  in tropical  and  parasitic 
diseases  (including  the formation  of task-forces  in relation  to the promotion  of research  in the major 
tropical  diseases); 
(3) intensifying  activities  for  the  coordination  of research  in environmental  health,  cancer,  cardiovascular  diseases,  virus  diseases  and  other  priority  problems; 
(4) completion  of the review  of the network  of reference  and  research  centres  collaborating  with  WHO 
in order  to evaluate  their  past  work  and  enhance  their  future  roles  in the Organization's  programme; 
(5) the  extension  of cooperation  among  and  coordination  between  the  efforts  of national  research 
institutions  in countries  that  show  a readiness  to participate  and  to provide  appropriate  facilities  and 
manpower  to collaborate  on problems  of prime  importance  to WHO; 
(6) enhancing  the role  of the Advisory  Committee  on Medical  Research  in formulating  and  evaluating 
the effectiveness  of the Organization's  long-term  research  programme,  and  improving  the constitutional 
utilization  of expert  committees  in this  regard; 
(7) further  encouraging  regional  committees  and  regional  offices  to implement  appropriate  programmes 
of biomedical  research; 
(8) establishing  or maintaining  close  contacts  with  national  and  international  bodies  dealing  with 
similar  programmes  ； 
3. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to intensify,  in accordance  with  resolution  WHA23.59,  on-going 
collations  and  analyses  of the long-term  biomedical  research  forecasts  and  prognoses  of Member  countries 
and appropriate  international  organizations  to guide  the Organization  in its own  work  and  long-term  programming; 
4. THANKS  those  governments  and  voluntary  agencies  which  have  contributed  funds  for promoting  WHO'S 
research  activities,  particularly  the special  programme  for research  and  training  in tropical  diseases  ； 
5. EXPRESSES  the hope  that  all Member  States  and  voluntary  agencies  will  make  funds  and  other  resources 
available  to the maximum  extent  possible  for the purpose  of forwarding  such  research  and  research  training 
activities,  with  special  emphasis  on the problems  of the developing  countries  ；  and 
6. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board  to examine  regularly  WHO  activities  in regard  to the development  and 
coordination  of biomedical  research,  paying  special  attention  to those  activities  in the Organization's  current 
and long-term  plans,  and  to report  on this  to the World  Health  Assembly.
