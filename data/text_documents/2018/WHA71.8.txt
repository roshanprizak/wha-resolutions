Agenda item 12.5 26 May 20 18 
Improving access to assistive technology  
The Seventy -first World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on improving access to assistive technology;1 
Considering that one billion people need assistive technology and that, as the global population 
ages and the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases increases, this figure will rise to more than two 
billion by 2050;2 
Noting that assistive technology enables and promotes the inclusion, participation and 
engagement of persons with disabilities, ageing populations and people with co -morbidities in the 
family, community and all areas of society, including the  political, economic and social spheres;  
Recalling that 90% of those who need assistive technology do not have access to it, and that this 
has a significant adverse impact on the education, livelihood, health and well -being of individuals, and 
on families,  communities and societies;1 
Recalling also the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its ultimate aim of “leaving 
no one behind”;  
Recognizing that the inclusion of assistive technology, in line with countries’ national priority 
and context, into hea lth systems is essential for realizing progress towards the targets in the 
Sustainable Development Goals relating to universal health coverage, inclusive and equitable quality 
education, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employ ment and decent 
work for all, reducing inequality within and among countries by empowering and promoting the 
social, economic and political inclusion of all, making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe and 
sustainable, and providing universal acces s to safe, inclusive and accessible green and public spaces, 
particularly for persons with disabilities;  
Recalling the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, under 
which 175 Member States have committed, inter alia, to ensuri ng access to quality assistive 
technology at an affordable cost (Article 20) and to foster international cooperation (Articles 4, 20, 26 
and 32) in support of national efforts for the realization of the purpose and objectives of the 
Convention;
