The Fifth World Health Assembly, I. Being aware of the great importance of full and fruitful international discussion of the implications of investigation of the economic value of preventive medicine ; Desirous of having such a discussion as the technical discussion at the Sixth World Health Assembly ; Recognizing the need forgiving immediate instructions to the Executive Board on this subject so that governments wishing to co-operate with the Organization in making studies may have ample time to do so, REQUESTS the Executive Board and the Director-General to proceed as soon as possible with arrange-ments for technical discussions at the Sixth World Health Assembly (including any arrangements necessary for studies in co-operation with interested governments) on the following two topics : (1) the relative place in health programmes, from both the long-term and short-term viewpoints, of preventive and curative work ; (2) comparative studies of different methods of applying the health techniques at present available, with particular reference to maximum results for least expenditure, and to the value of voluntary participation by the people served ; and II. Being aware of the intimate interrelationship between the economic value of health services and the wider economic and social fields covered by the family of the United Nations organizations, of which the World Health Organization is apart ; Realizing the need for well co-ordinated effort by all the international agencies to elucidate the social and economic mechanisms involved in raising levels of living and of human environment, CALLS UPON the Economic and Social Council, as the co-ordinating body under the Charter of the United Nations, to consider setting up studies tobe carried out jointly by the United Nations family of organizations, so that the principles of social and economic architecture maybe more fully understood and available to policy-making bodies, national and international.
