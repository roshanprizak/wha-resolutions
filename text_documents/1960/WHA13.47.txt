WHA13.47  Status  of Collection  of Annual  Contributions  and  of Advances  to the Working  Capital  Fund 
The Thirteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on the status  of collection  of contributions  and 
of advances  to the Working  Capital  Fund  as at 30 April  1960; 
Noting  that  the  collection  of contributions  was  slightly  less  satisfactory  than  at the  corresponding 
date in 1959;  and 
Noting  that  five  Members,  Bolivia,  Cuba,  Paraguay,  Uruguay  and  Yemen,  were  in arrears  for amounts 
which  equal  or exceed  their  contributions  for the preceding  two  full  years  ; and 
Noting  that  the four  of the Members  concerned  which  are represented  at the Thirteenth  World  Health 
Assembly  had  reported  that  they  were  making  or had  made  arrangements  to pay  all or a portion  of their 
arrears  ; 
Having  carefully  considered  the  provisions  of Article  7 of the  Constitution  and  the  provisions  of 
paragraph  2 of resolution  WHA8.13  relating  to the suspension  of voting  privileges, 
1. CALLS  THE  ATTENTION  of Member  governments  to the  importance  of paying  their  contributions  as 
early  as possible  in the  Organization's  financial  year; 
2. REQUESTS  Member  governments  that  have  not done  so to provide  in their  national  budgets  for regular 
payment  to the World  Health  Organization  of their  annual  contributions;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to communicate  with  the five  Members  in arrears  for two  years  or more 
and advise  them  that  the Health  Assembly  hopes  they  will  be able  to pay  their  contributions  as soon  as 
possible  and  in any  case  by the time  of the next  World  Health  Assembly,  in order  to avoid  the question 
of suspension  of voting  rights  as provided  in Article  7 of the Constitution.
