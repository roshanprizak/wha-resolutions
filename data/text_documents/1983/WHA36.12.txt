ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION  AND ALCOHOL-RELATED  PROBLEMS  : 
OF NATIONAL  POLICIES  AND PROGRAMMES DEVELOPMENT 
The Thirty-sixth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  previous  resolutions,  particularly  resolutions  WHA32.40,  concerning  the 
development  of WHO's programme  on alcohol-related  problems; 
Reiterating  its firm conviction  that alcohol-related  problems  rank among the world's 
major public health concerns  and constitute  a serious  hazard for human welfare,  and that it 
is therefore  necessary  for the Member States and for WHO to intensify  their efforts  to reduce 
these problems; 
Seriously  concerned  by the worldwide  trends in alcohol  consumption  and alcohol-related 
problems,  and by the promotional  drives for the increasing  consumption  of alcohol,  especially 
in countries  and in population  groups in which its use was not previously  widespread; 
Believing  that increasing  alcohol  consumption  and alcohol-related  problems  are incompatible 
with achieving  health for all by the year 2000，  and hence policies  to reduce them must form 
an integral  part of the strategy  for health for all; 
Recognizing  that an effective  strategy  to tackle the alcohol-related  problems  necessitates 
сomprehensivç  national  alcohol  policies; 
Mindful that effective  national  alcohol  policy requires  a concerted  effort consisting  of 
a wide variety  of measures  for prevention,  appropriate  services  for management  with emphasis 
on the primary  health care approacb,  and supporting  research  and evaluation,  giving high 
priority  to preventioa  by reducing  the availability  of and demand for alcohol; 
Noting with satisfaction  that the report of the WHO Expert Committee  on Problems  related 
to Alcohol  Consumptioix  provides  a thorough  and authoritative  summary  of current  knowledge 
applicable  in this field and contains  a number of important  recommendations  for WHO and Member 
States; 
Appreciating  the work already  carried  out by WHO, and recognizing  the important 
contribution  of the Technical  Discussions  held at the Thirty-fifth  World Health Assembly  on 
"Alcohol  consumption  and alcohol-related  problems"  for future developments; 
1. URGES Member States to identify  the actual and anticipated  problems  associated  with 
alcohol consumption; 
2. RECOMMENDS  that Member States : 
(1) formulate  comprehensive  national  policies,  with prevention  as a priority,  and with 
attention  to populations  at special  risk, within the framework  of the strategy  for health 
for all ；

suggested  in its report by the WHO Expert Committee  on Problems  related  to Alcohol

3. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board to monitor  and evaluate  the development  of WHO'S alcohol 
programme; 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to continue  and intensify  WHO'S programme  on alcohol-related  problems  as an integral 
part of the strategy  for health for all through  a primary  health care approach,  as 
envisaged  in the Seventh  General  Programme  of Work, and, in accordance  with 
resolution  WHA32.40: 
(a) to strengthen  further  WHO'S capacity  to respond  to requests  from Member States 
to support  their efforts  in dealing  with alcohol-related  problems; 
(b) to carry out studies  on factors  affecting  alcohol  consumption  patterns  and on 
measures  to influence  these patterns; 
(c) to promote  further  joint consideration  by the organizations  of the United Nations 
system and nongovernmental  organizations  of the problems  associated  with alcohol  and 
their alleviation; 
(d) to seek additional  funds from relevant  United Nations  bodies as well as 
governmental  and nongovernmental  sources; 
(2) to ensure that necessary  organizational,  staffing  and budgetary  implications  for the 
Organization  are taken into account  in the preparation  of the programme  budget for 
1986-1987; 
(3) to use all possible  mechanisms  for drawing  attention  and giving publicity  to health 
problems  related  to alcohol  consumption,  for example  by selecting  this topic as a theme 
for a future World Health Day; 
(4) to report on the progress  made to the Thirty-eighth  World Health Assembly.
