WHA17.50  Meetings  of the Regional  Committee  for Africa 
The Seventeenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  development  of the  situation  in the  African  Region  since  the  Sixteenth  World 
Health  Assembly; 
Considering  the  statement  made  by the African  delegates  at the last  meeting  of the Regional  Committee 
for Africa,  held  on 23 and  24 September  1963,  in Geneva; 
Noting  in particular  with  great  concern  the  gradual  deterioration  in this  situation  and  the  manifold 
consequences  which  may  result  therefrom  both  for  the  peoples  of the  countries  concerned  and  for  the 
Organization  as a whole; 
Reiterating  the  provisions  of resolution  WHA16.43  and,  in particular,  the  operative  paragraphs  2, 3, 
4, 5 and  7; 
Recalling  further  that,  according  to the provisions  of Article  7 of the Constitution,  the  Health  Assembly 
may,  in certain  exceptional  circumstances  and  on such  conditions  as it thinks  proper,  suspend  the  voting 
privileges  and  services  to which  a Member  is entitled; 
Considering  that  apartheid  officially  raised  to the  status  of a political  system  by a government  represents  an exceptional  circumstance  of failure  to adhere  to the  humanitarian  principles  governing  the  World 
Health  Organization,  and  therefore  makes  such  a government  liable  to the  penalties  provided  for  in the  said 
Article  7; 
Considering  that  the  Republic  of South  Africa  persists  in violating  the  Constitution  and  in ignoring 
the resolutions  of the World  Health  Organization  and  of the  United  Nations;  and 
Considering  that  the  mere  designation  of a representative  of the  Director-General  at Brazzaville  can 
in no way  bring  about  an appreciable  improvement  in this  situation, 
1. DECIDES  to apply  to the Republic  of South  Africa  the provisions  of Article  7 of the Constitution  relating 
to voting  privileges;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the  Executive  Board  and  the  Director-General  to submit  to the  Eighteenth  World  Health 
Assembly  formal  proposals  with  a view  to the suspension  or exclusion  from  the Organization  of any  Member 
violating  its principles  and  whose  official  policy  is based  on racial  discrimination.
