WHA17.45  Decisions  of the United  Nations,  Specialized  Agencies  and  the International  Atomic  Energy  Agency 
affecting  WHO'S  Activities 
The Seventeenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  General  Assembly  resolution  1931  (XVIII)  and  Economic  and  Social  Council  resolution  982 
(XXXVI)  on conversion  to peaceful  uses  of resources  released  by disarmament; 
Convinced  that  economic  development  will  open  sound  perspectives  for the solution  of the fundamental 
problems  which  beset  universal  conscience  today,  providing  all the  peoples  of the  world  with  the  effective 
possibility  of access  to adequate  levels  of health;  and 
Aware  of the  fact  that  the  solution  of such  problems  must  be envisaged  from  a global  point  of view 
which  takes  into  account  the  intimate  relationship  existing  between  development  and  international  peace 
and security, 
1. TAKES  NOTE  with  deep  appreciation  of the  reductions  in the  military  budgets  already  officially  declared 
by the two  main  armed  powers—the  Union  of Soviet  Socialist  Republics  and  the  United  States  of America— 
and of the  proposals  put  forth  before  the  Conference  of the  Eighteen-Nation  Committee  on Disarmament 
with  a view  to effecting  even  more  substantial  cuts  in the  years  to come; 
2. REQUESTS  the  United  Nations  to urge  the  Conference  of the  Eighteen-Nation  Committee  on Disarmament  to give  close  and  speedy  consideration  to the  proposals  submitted  to it recommending  the  application 
of the  resources  released  by way  of reductions  in military  budgets  in projects  leading  to the  conversion  of 
an economy  of war  into  an economy  of peace  and  in projects  aimed  at developing  economically  and  socially 
all countries  and  all  regions  and  areas  markedly  affected  by poverty  and  by  under-development,  thus 
enabling  them  to attain  a state  of complete  physical,  mental  and  social  well-being; 
3. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to consider  the  studies  recommended  in the  resolutions  and  to report 
to the  Executive  Board  his recommendation  for  any  action  he may  deem  it suitable  for  WHO  to undertake; 
and 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to transmit  this  resolution  to the  Secretary-General  of the  United 
Nations.
