The Forty-third World Health Assembly, Noting with concern that, as at 31 December 1989 : (a) the rate of collection in 1989 of current-year assessed contributions to the effective working budget amounted to 70.22%, the lowest rate since 1950 (b) only 94 Members had paid their current-year assessed contributions to the effective working budget in full, and 52 Members had made no payment towards their current-year contributions 1. EXPRESSES concern at the alarming deterioration in the payment of contributions, which has had a deleterious effect on the financial situation during the financial period 1988-1989; 2. CALLS THE ATTENTION of all Members to Financial Regulation 5.6, which provides that instalments of contributions and advances shall be considered as due and payable in full by the first day of the year to which they relate, and to the importance of paying contributions as early as possible to enable the Director-General to implement the programme budget in an orderly manner 3. RECALLS that, as a result of the adoption by resolution WHA41.12 of an incentive scheme to promote the timely payment of assessed contributions, Members paying their assessed contributions for 1990 early in the year will have their contributions payable for the 1992-1993 programme budget reduced appreciably, while Members paying later will see their contributions payable for the 1992-1993 programme budget reduced only marginally or not at all 4. URGES Members which are regularly late in the payment of their contributions to take urgently all steps necessary to ensure prompt and regular payment 5. REQUESTS the Director-General to draw the contents of this resolution to the attention of all Members. Thirteenth plenary meeting, 16 May 1990 A43 / VR / 13
