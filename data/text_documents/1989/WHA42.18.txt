make vigorous  efforts  to establish  an appropriate  health system and develop an adequate 
infrastructure  to ensure health for all Namibians； 
Emphasizing  the urgency of mobilizing  international  support  for this endeavour,  and 
the importance  of the role of WHO in this regard;

it the coming independence  of the Namibian  people; 
2. URGES Member States to adopt forthwith  the necessary  measures  to support fully the

Namibia, and to report on the action taken to the Forty-third  World Health Assembly; 
4. CALLS ON the specialized  bodies of the United Nations,  intergovernmental 
organizations  (such as the Organization  of African Unity) and nongovernmental 
organizations  to provide all the necessary  support  and cooperation  for this endeavour.
