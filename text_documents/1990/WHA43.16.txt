the significant  progress  made in many Member  States  in the implementation  of 
strategy; 
(b) the continuing  decline  in tobacco  consumption  in Member  States  that have 
adopted  comprehensive  smoking  control  policies； 
(c) recent  information  demonstrating  the effectiveness  of tobacco  control 
strategies,  and in particular: 
-legislation  or other measures  to provide  protection  from involuntary  exposure 
to tobacco  smoke in workplaces,  public  places  and public  transportation； 
-policies  to achieve  progressive  increases  in the real price of tobacco； 
-comprehensive  legislative  bans and other restrictive  measures  to effectively 
control  the direct  arid the indirect  advertising,  promotion  and sponsorship  of 
tobacco； 
Deeply concerned  by increasing  evidence  of the dangers  to health  of passive  smoking 
and by a new WHO estimate  that, unless  current  smoking  rates decrease,  there will be 
3 million  tobacco-related  deaths  per year during  the 1990s,  and that this figure  will 
rise quickly  to 10 million  deaths  per year by the 2020s； 
Believing  that millions  of future  premature  deaths  can be avoided  if current  smoking 
rates are quickly  and substantially  reduced; FORTY-THIRD  WORLD HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA43•16
