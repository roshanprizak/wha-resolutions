Agenda item 11.8 28 May 20 19 
Antimicrobial resistance  
 
The Seventy -second World Health Assembly,  
Having  considered  the report by the Director -General on follow -up to the high -level meetings of 
the United  Nations General Assembly on health -related issues: antimicrobial resistance ;1 
Recalling resolution 71/3 (2016), the political declaration of the high -level meeting of  the General 
Assembly on antimicrobial resistance, and acknowledging the establishment of the Interagency 
Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance to provide practical guidance and recommendations 
for necessary approaches to ensure sustained and effe ctive global action to address antimicrobial 
resistance;  
Recognizing the importance of addressing growing antimicrobial resistance to contribute to the 
achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;  
Reiterating the need to address antimicrobia l resistance through a coordinated, multisectoral, 
One Health approach;  
Recalling resolution WHA68.7 (2015) in which the Health Assembly adopted the global action 
plan on antimicrobial resistance, which lays out five strategic objectives (improve awareness  and 
understanding of antimicrobial resistance; strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research; 
reduce the incidence of infection; optimize the use of antimicrobial agents; and develop the economic 
case for sustainable investment), and noting the p rogress made in establishing the Global Antimicrobial 
Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS);  
Recognizing the pressing need for investing in high -quality research and development, including 
basic research for antimicrobials, diagnostic technologies, vaccin es and alternative preventive measures 
across sectors, and for ensuring adequate access to those in need of quality, safe, efficacious and 
affordable existing and new antimicrobials, diagnostic technologies and vaccines, while promoting 
effective stewardsh ip; 
Acknowledging the threat posed by resistant pathogens to the continuing effectiveness of 
antimicrobials, especially for ending the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria;  
Acknowledging also the positive effect of immunization, including vacci nation, and other 
infection prevention and control measures, such as adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), in 
reducing antimicrobial resistance;

2 Recognizing the need to maintain the production capacity of relevant older antibiotics and 
promote the ir prudent use;  
Recalling FAO resolution 4/2015 on antimicrobial resistance, World Organisation for Animal 
Health  (OIE) resolution No.  36 (2016) on combating antimicrobial resistance through a One Health 
approach: actions and OIE strategy, and the UNEP res olution UNEP/EA.3/Res.4 (2018) on environment 
and health;  
Noting the importance of providing opportunities for Member States to engage meaningfully with 
and provide input into reports, recommendations, and relevant actions from WHO, FAO, and OIE, 
together with UNEP, and from the Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance aimed 
at combating antimicrobial resistance;  
Reaffirming the global commitment to combat antimicrobial resistance with continued, high -level 
political efforts as a coordinat ed international community, emphasizing the critical need to accelerate 
Member States’ development and implementation of their national action plans with a One Health 
approach,  
1. WELCOMES the new tripartite agreement on antimicrobial resistance, and encou rages the 
Tripartite agencies (WHO, FAO, OIE) and UNEP to establish clear coordination for its implementation 
and to align reporting to their governing bodies on progress under the joint workplan, according to their 
respective  mandates;  
2. URGES Member  States:1 
(1) to remain committed at the highest political level to combating antimicrobial resistance, 
using a One Health approach, and to reducing the burden of disease, mortality, and disability 
associated with it;  
(2) to increase efforts to implement the actions and attain the strategic objectives of the global 
action plan on antimicrobial resistance, and take steps to address emerging issues;  
(3) to further enhance the prudent use of all antimicrobials, and consider developing and 
implementing clinical gu idelines and criteria according to which critically important 
antimicrobials should be used, in accordance with national priorities and context, in order to slow 
the emergence of drug resistance and sustain the effectiveness of existing drugs;  
(4) to condu ct post -market surveillance of antimicrobials and take appropriate action to 
eliminate substandard and falsified antimicrobials;  
(5) to strengthen efforts to develop, implement, monitor, and update, adequately resourced 
multisectoral national action plans;  
(6) to participate in the annual antimicrobial resistance country self -assessment survey 
administered by the Tripartite;  
                                                      
1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations.    WHA 72.5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  3 (7) to develop or strengthen monitoring systems that will contribute to the annual antimicrobial 
resistance country self -assessment su rvey administered by the Tripartite and to participation in 
the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance  System (GLASS), and to use this information 
to improve implementation of the national action plans;  
(8) to enhance cooperation at all levels for co ncrete action towards combat ing antimicrobial 
resistance, including through: health system strengthening; capacity -building, including for 
research and regulatory capacity; and technical support, including, where appropriate, through 
twinning programmes th at build on best practices, emerging evidence and innovation;  
(9) to support technology transfer on voluntary and mutually agreed terms for controlling and 
preventing antimicrobial resistance;  
3. INVITES international, regional, and national partners, and other relevant stakeholders:
