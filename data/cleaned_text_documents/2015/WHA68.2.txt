0 The Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report on malaria: draft global technical strategy: post 2015 ;1 Recalling resolutions WHA58.2 on malaria control, WHA60.18 on malaria, including proposal for establishment of World Malaria Day and WHA64.17 on malaria, and United Nations General Assembly resolutions 65 / 273, 66 / 289, 67 / 299 and 68 / 308 on consolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control and eliminate malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa, by 2015; Acknowledging the progress made towards the achievement of Millennium Development Goal 6 (Combat HIV / AIDS, malaria and other diseases), and towards the targets set by the Health Assembly in resolution WHA58.2; Recognizing that these gains, when complemented by further investments in new cost-effective interventio ns, provide an opportunity to further reduce the high burden of malaria and accelerate progress towards elimination; Noting that approximately 200 million cases of malaria are estimated to have occurred in 2013; that the disease led to more than 580 000 de aths in 2013, mostly in children under five years of age in Africa, and imposes a significant burden on households, communities and health services in high-burden countries; and that the number of cases and deaths will increase unless efforts to reduce the disease burden are intensified; Recognizing that malaria interventions are highly cost-effective, yet there is a need to urgently address and overcome the barriers that hinder universal access of at-risk populations to vector-control measures, preventive therapies, quality-assured diagnostic testing and treatment for malaria; Recognizing also that malaria-related morbidity and mortality throughout the world can be substantially reduced with political commitment and commensurate resources if the public is educated and sensitized about malaria and appropriate health services are made available, particularly in countries where the disease is endemic; Deeply concerned by the regional and global health threat posed by the emergence and spread of insecticide and drug resistance, including artemisinin resistance, and the systemic challenges impeding further progress, including weak health and disease surveillance systems in many affected countries; 1 Document A68 / 28. WHA6 8.2 2 Cognizant of the grave economic and social burden that malaria infl icts on the most vulnerable and poorest communities in countries in which malaria is endemic, and of the disproportionate burden that is borne by countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and high-risk groups, including migrant and mobile populations; Cognizant also that a reduction in the malaria burden can improve social conditions and lift communities out of poverty, and that it has a positive economic and social impact; Acknowledging that recent successes in malaria prevention and control are fragile and that further progress depends on action within and beyond the health sector, which requires long-term political and financial commitments, strong regional collaboration, the strengthening of health systems, and investments in innovation and research; Recognizing that in the interconnected and interdependent world, no country is risk-free in respect of malaria, including countries that have recently eliminated the disease and countries that are non-endemic for malaria, 1. ADOPTS the global technical strategy for malaria 2016 2030, with: (1) its bold vision of a world free of malaria, and its targets to reduce malaria incidence and mortality rates globally by at least 90% by 2030, to eliminate the disease in at least 35 new countries, and to prevent its re-establishm ent in countries that were free of malaria in 2015; (2) its associated milestones for 2020 and 2025; (3) its five principles addressing: acceleration of efforts towards elimination; country ownership and leadership, with the involvement and participation of communities; improved surveillance, monitoring and evaluation; equity in access to health services; and innovation in tools and implementation approaches; (4) its three pillars of: ensuring universal access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment; accelerating efforts towards elimination and attainment of malaria-free status; and transforming malaria surveillance into a core intervention; (5) its two supporting elements of: harnessing innovation and expanding research; and strengthening the enablin g environment; 2. URGES Member States:1 (1) to update national malaria strategies and operational plans consistent with the recommendations of the global technical strategy for malaria 2016 2030; (2) to intensify national and regional efforts to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality in high-burden countries and accelerate progress towards elimination, and, where appropriate, maintain malaria-free status; 1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations. WHA6 8.2 3 (3) to strengthen health systems, including both the public and private sectors, and devise plans fora chieving and maintaining universal access on the part of at-risk populations to WHO-recommended core malaria interventions; (4) to intensify national, cross-border, regional and subregional efforts to address the threat posed by rising insecticide and drug resistance, including artemisinin resistance; (5) to promote multisectoral collaboration, educational programmes, and community involvement in order to strengthen efforts for malaria control and elimination; (6) to establish and strengthen, as appropriate , national malaria surveillance and response systems in order to improve the quality of data and the effectiveness and efficiency of national malaria responses; (7) to develop a comprehensive cross border malaria control and treatment model, where appropri ate, strengthen cross border collaboration, improve the effectiveness of malaria elimination using primary health care as the main platform , and integrate the model into broader health delivery systems; (8) to promote basic and applied research into malaria and accelerate the rapid development and adoption of good-quality and cost-effective new tools, in particular vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, surveillance, insecticides and vector control tools to prevent and control malaria, and to collaborate on new approaches; (9) to strengthen human resource capacity and infrastructure to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of malaria responses, while ensuring integration and synergies with the wider health system; (10) to consider the financial implications of this resolution in the broader context of health sector development, and increase national, regional and international funding for malaria interventions, and for cross-border and regional initiatives; 3. INVITES international, regional and national partners from within and beyond the health sector, in particular those in the RollBack Malaria Partnership, to engage in, and support, the implementation of the global technical strategy for malaria 2016 2030; 4. CALLS UPON WHOs international p artners, including intergovernmental and international organizations, financing bodies, academic and research institutions, civil society and the private sector to support Member States as appropriate: (1) to mobilize sufficient and predictable funding to enable an accelerated reduction of the malaria burden, particularly in high-burden countries, and progress towards elimination, in line with the milestones and targets proposed in the global technical strategy for malaria 2016 2030; (2) to support knowledge generation, research and innovation to speed up the development of new vector-control tools, diagnostics, medicines and vaccines, and of new surveillance, data management, operational delivery and implementation solutions; 1 And, where applicable, regional economic integration organizations.
