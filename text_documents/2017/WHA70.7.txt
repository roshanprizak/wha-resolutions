 
  SEVENTIETH  WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY  WHA 70.7 
Agenda item 12.2  29 May 2017 
Improving the prevention, diagnosis and clinical 
management of sepsis  
 
The Seventieth  World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on improving the prevention, diagnosis and clinical management 
of sepsis;1 
Concerned that sepsis continues to cause approximately six million deaths worldwide every 
year, most of which are preventable;  
Recognizing that sepsis a s a syndromic response to infection is the final common pathway to 
death from most infectious diseases worldwide;  
Considering that sepsis follows a unique and time -critical clinical course, which in the early 
stages is highly amenable to treatment through early diagnosis and timely and appropriate clinical 
management;  
Considering also that infections which may lead to sepsis can often be prevented through 
appropriate hand hygiene, access to vaccination programmes, improved sanitation and water quality 
and a vailability, and other infection prevention and control best practices; and that forms of 
septicaemia associated with nosocomial infections are severe, hard to control and have high fatality rates;  
Recognizing that while sepsis itself cannot always be pred icted, its ill effects in terms of 
mortality and long- term morbidity can be mitigated through early diagnosis and appropriate and 
timely clinical management;  
Recognizing also the need to improve measures for the prevention of infections and control of 
the consequences of sepsis, due to inadequate infection prevention and control programmes, 
insufficient health education and recognition in respect of early sepsis, inadequate access to affordable, 
timely and appropriate treatment and care, and insufficient laboratory services, as well as the lack of 
integrated approaches to the prevention and clinical management of sepsis;  
Noting that health care -associated infections represent a common pathway through which sepsis 
can place an increased burden on health care resources;

Considering the need for an integrated approach to tackling sepsis that focuses on prevention, 
early recognition through clinical and laboratory services, and timely access to health care, including 
intensive care services, with reliability in the delivery of the basics of care, including intravenous 
fluids and the timely administration of antimicrobials, where indicated;  
Acknowledging that: (i) the inappropriate and excessive use of antimicrobials contributes to the 
threat of antimicrobial resistance; (ii) the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance adopted in 
resolution WHA68.7 (2015),1 as well as resolution WHA67.25 (2014), urged WHO to accelerate 
efforts to secure access to effective antimicrobials and to use them responsibly and p rudently; 
(iii) sepsis represents the most vital indication for the responsible use of effective antimicrobials for 
human health; (iv) in the absence of appropriate and timely clinical management, including effective 
antimicrobials, sepsis would be almost universally fatal; (v) ineffective or incomplete antimicrobial 
therapy for infections, including sepsis, may be a major contributor to the increasing threat of 
antimicrobial resistance; (vi) the incidence of some resistant pathogens may be reduced by the u se of 
appropriate vaccines; and (vii) immunocompromised patients are most at risk from very serious forms 
of septicaemia;  
Recognizing that many vaccine -preventable diseases are major contributors to sepsis and 
reaffirming resolution WHA45.17 (1992) on immunization and vaccine quality, which urged Member 
States, inter alia, to integrate cost -effective and affordable new vaccines into national immunization 
programmes in countries where this is feasible;  
Recognizing also the importance of strong, functional he alth systems, which include 
organizational and therapeutic strategies in order to improve patient safety and outcomes from sepsis of bacterial origin;  
Further recognizing the need to prevent and control sepsis, to increase timely access to correct 
diagnosi s and to provide appropriate treatment programmes;  
Also recognizing the advocacy efforts of stakeholders, in particular through existing activities 
held every year on 13 September
2 in many countries, to raise awareness regarding sepsis,  
1. URGES Member Sta tes:3 
(1) to include prevention, diagnosis and treatment of sepsis in national health systems 
strengthening in the community and in health care settings, according to WHO guidelines;  
(2) to reinforce existing strategies or develop new ones leading to strengthened infection 
prevention and control programmes, including by strengthening hygienic infrastructure, 
promoting hand hygiene, and other infection prevention and control best practices, clean 
childbirth practices, infection prevention practices in surger y, improvements in sanitation, 
nutrition and delivery of clean water, access to vaccination programmes, provision of effective 
personal protective equipment for health professionals and infection control in health care 
settings;

(3) to continue in their ef forts to reduce antimicrobial resistance and promote the appropriate 
use of antimicrobials in accordance with the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance,1 
including the development and implementation of comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship 
activ ities;  
(4) to develop and implement standard and optimal care and strengthen medical 
countermeasures for diagnosing and managing sepsis in health emergencies, including 
outbreaks, through appropriate guidelines with a multisectoral approach;  
(5) to increas e public awareness of the risk of progression to sepsis from  infectious diseases, 
through health education, including on patient safety, in order to ensure prompt initial contact 
between affected persons and the health care system;  
(6) to develop training for all health professionals on infection prevention and patient safety, 
and on the importance of recognizing sepsis as a preventable and time -critical condition with 
urgent therapeutic need, and of communicating with patients, relatives and other parties using 
the term “sepsis” in order to enhance public awareness;  
(7) to promote research aimed at innovative means of diagnosing and treating sepsis across 
the lifespan, including research for new antimicrobial and alternative medicines, rapid 
diagnostic test s, vaccines and other important technologies, interventions and therapies;  
(8) to apply and improve the use of the International Classification of Diseases system to 
establish the prevalence and profile of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance, and to devel op and 
implement monitoring and evaluation tools in order to focus attention on and monitor progress towards improving outcomes from sepsis, including the development and fostering of specific 
epidemiologic surveillance systems, and to guide evidence- based  strategies for policy decisions 
related to preventive, diagnostic and treatment activities and access to relevant health care for 
survivors;  
(9) to engage further in advocacy efforts to raise awareness of sepsis, in particular through 
supporting existing activities held every year on 13 September in Member States;
