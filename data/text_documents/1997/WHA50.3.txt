Guidelines  on the WHO  Certification  Scheme  on the 
Quality  of Pharmaceutical  Products  moving  in 
International  Commerce 
The Fiftieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Taking  note  of previous  resolutions  on WHO's  Certification  Scheme  on the Quality  of Pharmaceutical 
Products  moving  in International  Commerce,  and particularly  resolutions  WHA45.29  and WHA49.14; 
Having  reviewed  the revised  guidelines  on implementation  of the Certification  Scheme  which  are the 
result  of field  trials  in a number  of WHO  Member  States  and discussions  during  the sixth  and seventh  biennial 
International  Conferences  of Drug  Regulatory  Authorities;1 
Believing  that the adoption  of the revised  guidelines  will provide  an important  instrument  in support  of 
drug registration  in the importing  country  by ensuring  access  to transparent  information  on the regulatory  status 
of the pharmaceutical  product  in the exporting  country  and the true origin  of products  to be imported, 
1. ENDORSES  the guidelines  for implementation  of the WHO  Certification  Scheme  on the Quality  of 
Pharmaceutical  Products  moving  in International  Commerce  and associated  model  certification  forms; 
2. URGES  Member  States: 
(1) to  implement  these  guidelines,  and to issue  and request  WHO-type  certificates  in the form  contained 
in the guidelines  as from  1 January  1998  and to issue  the certificates  in the form  proposed; 
(2) to  inform  the Director-General  of their  intent  to apply  the Scheme  and  of any  significant 
reservations  they  intend  to express  relating  to their  participation  as provided  for in article  2.1 of the 
guidelines.
