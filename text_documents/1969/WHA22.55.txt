WHA22.55 Second  United  Nations  Development  Decade 
The Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly, 
Desiring  to achieve  the highest  possible  standard  of health  in the next  decade,  which  is essential  for the 
development  of each  individual  nation  as well  as the  world  as a whole; 
Bearing  in mind  that  the  improvement  of health  during  the First  United  Nations  Development  Decade 
has not  been  sufficiently  satisfactory; 
Aware  of the  increasing  need  in developing  and  developed  countries  for  more  accelerated  health 
improvement; 
Aware  also  of the fact  that,  while  the primary  responsibility  for improvement  in the developing  countries 
rests  upon  themselves,  their  development  depends  to a considerable  extent  on external  financial,  technical 
and material  assistance; 
Recalling  resolution  2411  (XXIII)  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly  concerning  the international 
development  strategy  for the 1970s  decade  ； 
Recalling  resolution  2436  (XXIII)  of the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  concerning  the  world 
social  situation; 
Recalling  further  resolutions  WHA20.52  and  WHA20.53  of the Twentieth  World  Health  Assembly;  and 
Noting  with  satisfaction  that  the  Organization  has  so far actively  contributed  to the  preparations  for 
the Second  United  Nations  Development  Decade, 
1. CALLS  UPON  Member  States  to intensify  their  efforts,  strengthen  their  co-operation  and  utilize  all available 
resources  in order  to accelerate  health  development  during  the  Second  Development  Decade  and  invites 
those  which  have  not already  done  so to incorporate  health  priorities  and  objectives  into  their  overall  national 
socio-economic  plans  and  projections  for  the  Decade  ； 
2. CONSIDERS  that,  within  the general  framework  of health  promotion,  the global  priority  objectives  should 
be the following,  not  necessarily  in the order  mentioned: 
the training  of health  service  personnel  at all levels,  with  emphasis  on the  education  and  training  of 
national  health  cadres  in the developing  countries; 
the planning,  organization  and  operation  of systems  and  institutions  through  which  the  health  service 
personnel  can  provide  to the population  they  serve  every  form  of health  care—preventive,  curative  and 
restorative一including  maternal  and  child  care  and  family  planning  services  upon  request,  the  utmost 
attention  being  given  to the fullest  possible  application  of the new  scientific  and  medical  discoveries  and 
knowledge  accumulated,  particularly  in developing  such  services  for the largest  possible  segment  of the 
population  in developing  countries; 
intensification  and  extension  of activities  in the  prevention,  control  and  eradication  of communicable 
and other  mass  diseases  which  burden  so heavily  the  developing  nations  and  delay  their  economic 
progress,  such  as malaria,  smallpox,  trypanosomiasis  and  tuberculosis; 
the elimination  of nutritional  disorders  and  the general  improvement  of the nutritional  state  of vulnerable 
population  groups; 
the improvement  of the conditions  of health  and  hygiene  in which  people  live  and  work; 
the support  and  co-ordination  of research—basic,  applied  and  operational; 
3. URGES  the developed  countries  to increase  the level  of financial,  technical  and  material  assistance  to the 
developing  countries,  to make  it possible  for them  to achieve  their  goals  in the  field  of health  during  the 
Second  Development  Decade  ； and 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to continue  to co-operate  with  other  organizations  of the United  Nations 
system  in the formulation  of the international  strategy  for the Decade  and  in related  activities,  and  to report 
to the Executive  Board  and  to the Twenty-third  World  Health  Assembly  on the action  pursued  and  progress 
made  in the health  component  of the international  strategy  for the Second  Development  Decade.
