THIRTY-FOURTH  WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA34.27 
22 May 1981 
USE OF SI UNITS IN MEDICINE:  USE OF THE KILOPASCAL 
FOR BLOOD PRESSURE  MEASUREMENT 
The Thirty-fourth  World Health Assembly, 
Having considered  the international  difficulties  being encountered  in attempting  to 
introduce  the kilopascal,  the unit of the Système  international  d'Unités  (SI) for the 
measurement  of blood pressure； 
Noting the attitudes  and resolutions  of international  scientific  bodies objecting  to 
the precipitate  replacement  of the millimetre  of mercury  by the kilopascal； 
Further noting with concern  the ensuing  difficulties  encountered  in communication 
between the scientific  community  and the population  in a number of Member States； 
Mindful,  nevertheless,  of the desirability  of a unified  international  system of units 
as expressed  in earlier  resolutions； 
Considering  the high prevalence  of hypertension,  its deleterious  effect,  and the high 
probability  for its prevention  by early screening; 
Recalling  the caution  expressed  in resolution  WHA29.65  and WHA30.39  regarding  the 
difficulties  that might arise through  the precipitate  introduction  into medical  practice 
of certain  units of the SI, with particular  reference  to the substitution  of the kilopascal 
for the millimetre  of mercury  in the measurement  of blood pressure； 
1. CONSIDERS  that there is no compelling  need to replace  the millimetre  of mercury  by the 
kilopascal  in medical  practice  at the present  time； 
2. RECOMMENDS  that the millimetre  of mercury  and the kilopascal  be used simultaneously 
until a future World Health Assembly  considers  the retention  of the millimetre  of mercury 
unnecessary  for the undisturbed  delivery  of health care 
information；  and， 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to draw attention  to 
Organization's  journals  as well as through  the media of 
organizations. and the interchange  of scientific 
the present  resolution  in the 
the relevant  nongovernmental 
Sixteenth  plenary  meeting,  22 May 1981
