WHA26.59  Development  of environmental  manpower 
The Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA21.20  and  WHA23.35  concerning  the  training  of health  personnel  and 
resolutions  WHA24.47  and  WHA25.58  concerning  the human  environment; 
Referring  to Recommendation  No.  7 of the United  Nations  Conference  on the Human  Environment, 
held in Stockholm  in June  1972,  which  stresses  the need  to institute  specialized  training  programmes  in regard 
to environmental  matters; 
Considering  that  the  prevention  of the hazards  resulting  from  harmful  environmental  factors  requires 
the participation  of very  different  types  of personnel  responsible  for  a large  variety  of tasks  within  the 
health  services,  other  bodies,  industry  and  research  ； 
Aware  of the complexity,  diversity  and  extent  of the health  problems  that  these  hazards  entail  and  that 
are frequently  more  than  national  in scope,  in both  developed  and  developing  countries  ； 
Recognizing  the  need  to provide  the  various  categories  of health  and  environmental  manpower  with 
common  multidisciplinary  knowledge,  thus  ensuring  the  unity  of views  that  is indispensable  for  public 
health  purposes, 
1. RECOMMENDS  that  Member  States  : 
(1) introduce  or strengthen  teaching  of the health  sciences  within  training  programmes  for the various 
categories  of environmental  manpower  ； 
(2) give  priority  to the  use  of such  manpower  within  the  institutions  responsible  for  planning  and 
carrying  out  coordinated  programmes  to promote  health  and  to improve  the human  environment,  as 
well as at all operational  levels  ； 
2. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  : 
(1) to extend  the  assistance  given  to Member  States  in determining  their  requirements  for  environmental  manpower  in connexion  with  health  ； 
(2) to provide  assistance  and  means  of coordination  for  the preparation  and  implementation  of programmes  at the regional  and  interregional  levels  for the training  of specialists  in health,  human  ecology 
and environmental  sciences  and  technology; 
(3) to contribute  to those  training  programmes  in so far as budgetary  resources  permit,  by providing 
fellowships  and  qualified  teaching  staff,  by organizing  long-term  and  short-term  courses,  seminars  and 
other  meetings  in order  to promote  the  acquisition  of skills  and  the  exchange  of knowledge  and  information,  on the basis  of a systematic  approach  to the planning  of training,  and  by studying  the possibility  of designating  international  and  regional  centres  for the training  of environmental  manpower; 
(4) to continue  to collaborate  with  other  intergovernmental  institutions  and  with  the  nongovernmental  organizations  concerned  with  a view  to coordinating  the  various  aspects  of the  training  programmes  ；and 
3. ASKS  governments  for voluntary  contributions  with  a view  to the rapid  establishment  and  development 
of programmes  for  training  environmental  manpower,  programmes  which  could  also  benefit  from  contributions  derived  from  other  sources.
