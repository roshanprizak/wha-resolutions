The Thirteenth World Health Assembly, Having considered the report of the Director-General on his study of the possibilities of reducing the length of World Health Assemblies ; Having considered the minutes of the discussion on this subject in the Executive Board, and the Board's resolution EB25.R56; Bearing in mind the Organization's increasing membership; and Being of the opinion that continuous efforts should be made to reduce the length of Assemblies insofar as maybe consistent with the requirements and work of each Assembly, 1. REQUESTS the Executive Board and the Director-General to give consideration to the various suggestions made during discussion of this subject at the Thirteenth World Health Assembly, and to present to the Fourteenth World Health Assembly concrete proposals for reducing as far as possible the length of Assemblies, without reducing the total amount of time tobe devoted to technical discussions ; and further 2. REQUESTS the Director-General and the Executive Board in preparing the proposed agenda for the Health Assembly to bear in mind the possibility of combining items with a view to avoiding duplicate discussion.
