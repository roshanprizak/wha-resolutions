The Fifty-eighth World Health Assembly, Having examined the report on the prevention and control of cancer;1 Recalling resolutions WHA51.18 and WHA53.17 on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, WHA57.17 on the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, WHA56.1 on tobacco control, WHA57.12 on the reproductive health strategy, including control of cervical cancer, and WHA57.16 on health promotion and healthy lifestyles; Recognizing the suffering of cancer patients and their families and the extent to which cancer threatens development when it affects economically active members of society; Alarmed by the rising trends of cancer risk-factors, the number of new cancer cases, and cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide, in particular in developing countries; Recognizing that many of these cases of cancer and deaths could be prevented, and that the provision of palliative care for all individuals in need is an urgent, humanitarian responsibility; Recognizing that the technology for diagnosis and treatment of cancer is mature and that many cases of cancer maybe cured, especially if detected earlier; Recognizing that tobacco use is the worlds most avoidable cause of cancer and that control measures, such as legislation, education, promotion of smoke-free environments, and treatment of tobacco dependence, can be effectively applied in all resource settings; Recognizing that among all cancer sites cervical cancer, causing 11% of all cancer deaths in women in developing countries, has one of the greatest potential for early detection and cure, that costeffective interventions for early detection are available and not yet widely used, and that the control of cervical cancer will contribute to the attainment of international development goals and targets related to reproductive health; Recognizing the value of multidisciplinary management and the importance of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care and other approaches in the treatment of cancer; Recognizing the contribution of IARC, over 40 years, to research on cancer etiology and prevention, providing evidence on global cancer prevalence and incidence, the causes of cancer, mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and effective strategies for cancer prevention and early detection; Mindful of the need for careful planning and prior ity-setting in the use of resources in order to undertake effective activities to reduce the cancer burden; Recognizing the importance of adequate funding for cancer-prevention, control and palliativecare programmes, especially in developing countries; 1 Document A58 / 16. 104 FIFTY-EIGHTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY Encouraged by the prospects offered by partnerships with international and national organizations within the Global Alliance for Cancer Control, and other bodies such as patient organizations; Recognizing the support given by IAEA to combat cancer, and welcoming the initiative of the Agency to establish the Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy, and research efforts of national cancer institutes in various Member States, 1.

ANNEX NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMMES: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OUTCOM E-ORIENTED OBJECTIVES National health authorities may wish to consider the following outcome-oriented objectives for their cancer control programmes, according to type of cancer:  preventable tumours (such as those of lung, colon, rectum, skin and liver): to avoid and reduce exposure to risk factors (such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets, harmful use of alcohol, sedentariness, excess exposure to sunlight, communicable agents, including hepatitis B virus and liver fluke, and occupational exposures), thus limiting cancer incidence;  cancers amenable to early detection and treatment (such as oral, cervical, breast and prostate cancers): to reduce late presentation and ensure appropriate treatment, in order to increase survival, reduce mortality and improve quality of life;  disseminated cancers that have potential of being cured or the patients lives prolonged considerably (such as acute leukaemia in childhood): to provide appropriate care in order to increase survival, reduce mortality and improve quality of life;  advanced cancers: to enhance relief from pain and other symptoms and improve quality of life of patients and their families.
