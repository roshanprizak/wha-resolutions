Agenda item 16.2 27 May 2013 
Neglected tropical diseases 
 
The Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on neglected tropical diseases,1 and recalling the previous World 
Health Assembly resolutions listed therein; 
Recognizing that increased national and internatio nal investments in prevention and control of 
neglected tropical diseases have succeeded in im proving health and social well-being in many 
countries; 
Recognizing also the importance of the Global Plan to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases 
2008–2015; 
Noting WHO’s roadmap to accelerate the work to  overcome the global impact of neglected 
tropical diseases;1 
Acknowledging the linkages between, and mutual supportiveness of, control and elimination of 
neglected tropical diseases and the global strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and 
intellectual property; 
Acknowledging also that expansion of activities to prevent and control neglected tropical 
diseases will need adequately resourced national programmes functioning within effective health, 
education and other sectors in order to provide  for an uninterrupted supply and delivery of 
quality-assured commodities and services; 
Realizing that current approaches to the preven tion and control of neglected tropical diseases, 
when implemented in an integrated manner and ac ross all relevant sectors, are highly effective and 
contribute to stronger health systems and the achievement of the health-related Millennium 
Development Goals, but that there are still many challenges; 
Appreciating the generous contribution of pha rmaceutical companies in donating sufficient 
quantities of quality-assured essential medicines for the pr evention and treatment of neglected tropical 
diseases, while acknowledging the need to ensure th eir continuous availability and affordability; 
Recognizing the contribution of bodies in the United Nations system, intergovernmental and 
nongovernmental organizations, academic  institutions and civil society;

2 Recognizing also the diversity of neglected tropi cal diseases, their causative agents and relevant 
vectors and intermediate hosts, their epidemic potential (such as for dengue, Chagas disease, human 
rabies of canine origin and leishmaniasis), a nd their morbidity, mortality and associated 
stigmatization, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to ensure continued country ownership of programmes for neglected tropical disease 
prevention, control, elimination and eradication; 
(2) to further strengthen the disease surveilla nce system especially on neglected tropical 
diseases targeted for eradication; 
(3) to expand and implement, as appropriate, interventions against neglected tropical diseases 
in order to reach the targets agreed  in the Global Plan to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases 
2008–2015,  as set out in WHO’s roadmap for accelerating work to overcome the global impact 
of neglected tropical diseases and noting the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical 
Diseases by; 
(a) ensuring that resources match national requirements and flow in a sustainable 
manner as a result of thorough planning and costing of prevention and control activities 
and detailed analysis of associated expenditures; 
(b) enabling improvement of the management of the supply chain, in particular 
through forecasting, timely procurem ent of quality-assured goods, improved 
stock-management systems, and facilita ting importation and customs clearance; 
(c) integrating neglected tropical diseases control programmes into primary health care 
services and vaccination campaigns, or into ex isting programmes where feasible, in order 
to achieve greater coverage and reduce operational costs; 
(d) ensuring appropriate programme mana gement and implementation through the 
development, sustenance and supervision of  a cadre of skilled staff (including other 
sectors than health) at national, district and community levels; 
(4) to advocate predictable, long-term, interna tional financing for the control of neglected 
tropical diseases; 
(5) to enhance and sustain national financial commitments, including resource mobilization 
from sectors other than health; 
(6) to strengthen capacity for prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases, 
strengthening research, in order to accelerate implementation of the policies and strategies designed to achieve the targets set by the Health  Assembly in various resolutions related to 
specific neglected tropical diseases as well as in the roadmap and the London Declaration; 
(7) to strengthen national capacity for monitoring and evaluation of the impact of 
interventions against neglected tropical diseases;   WHA66.12 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  (8) to devise plans for achieving and maintain ing universal access to and coverage with 
interventions against neglect ed tropical diseases, notably: 
(a) to provide prompt diagnostic testing of  all suspected cases of neglected tropical 
diseases and effective treatment with appropria te therapy of patients in both the public 
and private sectors at all levels of the health system including the community level; 
(b) to implement and sustain coverage with preventive chemotherapy1 of at least 75% 
of the populations in need, as a prerequisite  for achieving goals of disease control or 
elimination; 
(c) to improve coordination for reducing transmission and strengthening control of 
neglected tropical diseases taking into account social determinants of health,  through 
provision of safe drinking-water, basic sanitati on, health promotion and education, vector 
control and veterinary public health, taking into consideration One Health;  
2. CALLS upon WHO’s international partners, in cluding intergovernmental, international and 
nongovernmental organizations, fina ncing bodies, academic and research  institutions, civil society and 
the private sector: 
(1) to support Member States, as appropriate: 
(a) to provide sufficient and predictable funding to enable the targets for 2015 and 
2020 to be met and efforts to control neglected tropical diseases to be sustained; 
(b) to harmonize the provision of support to countries for implementing a national plan 
based on WHO-recommended policies and stra tegies and using commodities that meet 
international quality standards; 
(c) to promote universal access to preventi ve chemotherapy, and diagnostics, case 
management, and vector control and other prevention measures, as well as effective 
surveillance systems; 
(2) to encourage initia tives for the research  and development of new diagnostics, medicines, 
vaccines, and pesticides and biocides, improve d tools and technologies and other innovative 
instruments for vector control and infection pr evention and to support operational research to 
increase the efficiency and cost–effectiveness of interventions, taking into account the global 
strategy and plan of action on public he alth, innovation and intellectual property;  
(3) to collaborate with WHO in order to provi de support to Member States in measuring 
progress towards, and in accomplishing, their goals of elimination and eradication of selected 
neglected tropical diseases;
