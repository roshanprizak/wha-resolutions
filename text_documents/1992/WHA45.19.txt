SUPPORT  TO DROUGHT-STRICKEN  COUNTRIES  OF 
SOUTHERN  AFRICA 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Deeply  concerned  that severe  drought  is threatening  human  life and is causing  serious  loss of livestock 
and food  crops  in the countries  of southern  Africa; 
Recalling  United  Nations  General  Assembly  resolution  46/182  (1991)  on strengthening  the coordination 
of humanitarian  emergency  assistance  by the United  Nations; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA36.29,  WHA37.29  and WHA38.29  on drought; 
Considering  that serious  undernutrition  is likely  to affect  millions  of inhabitants  of southern  Africa, 
especially  vulnerable  groups  of pregnant  and lactating  mothers,  children  under  five years  of age, and the elderly 
in the affected  countries; 
Aware  that the consequences  of undernutrition  arising  from  this natural  disaster  fall directly  within  the 
competence  of WHO; 
Noting  that the affected  governments  have  declared  a national  emergency  as a result  of the drought,  have 
appealed  for international  emergency  assistance,  and have  taken  steps  to coordinate  the relief  efforts  with the 
United  Nations  and the donor  community; 
Realizing  that the effects  of the drought  will directly  affect  the development  programmes  in the affected 
countries, 
1. CALLS  ON the international  community,  including  bilateral  donors,  specialized  agencies  and other 
organizations  of the United  Nations  system,  and nongovernmental  organizations,  to assist  in resource 
mobilization  and coordination  of the relief  efforts  to alleviate  the effects  of the drought; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to support  the efforts  of the affected  countries  in coordinating  the emergency  relief  programme; 
(2) to bring  to the attention  of the appropriate  bodies  of the United  Nations  system  the need  to 
provide  immediate  substantial  assistance  in the way of food for the affected  countries; 
(3) to mobilize  the emergency  prophylactic  and therapeutic  supplies  which  will invariably  be required 
to counteract  the negative  effects  of the drought  on health  and development; 
(4) to mobilize  adequate  resources  for the implementation  of immediate,  medium-  and long-term 
health  activities  in the affected  countries;

(5) to report  to the Forty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly  on progress  made  in the implementation  of 
this resolution.
