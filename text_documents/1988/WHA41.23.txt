LIBERATION  STRUGGLE  IN SOUTHERN  AFRICA: ASSISTANCE  TO THE 
FRONT-LINE  STATES, LESOTHO AND SWAZILAND 
The Forty-first  World Health Assembly, 
Considering  that the front-line  States continue  to suffer from the consequences  of 
military,  political  and economic  destabilization  by South Africa which hamper their 
economic and social development; 
Considering  that the front-line  States have to accept enormous  sacrifices  to 
rehabilitate  and develop their health infrastructure  which has suffered  as a result of 
destabilization  by South Africa; 
Considering  also resolutions  AFR/RC31/R12  and AFR/RC32/R9  of the Regional  Committee 
for Africa, which call for a special programme  for health cooperation  with the People's 
Republic of Angola; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA39.24  and WHA40.23  adopted  at the Thirty-ninth  and Fortieth 
Assembly respectively; 
Bearing in mind that the consequences  of these destabilization  activities  still 
force the countries  concerned  to divert large amounts of financial  and technical 
resources  from their national  health programmes  to defence and reconstruction; 
THANKS the Director-General  for his report; 
RESOLVES that WHO shall: 1 
(1) continue  to take appropriate  and timely measures  to help the front-line  States, 
Lesotho and Swaziland  solve the acute health problems  of the Namibian  and South 
African refugees；

by South Africa with technical  cooperation  in the health field, for the 
rehabilitation  of their damaged health infrastructures；
