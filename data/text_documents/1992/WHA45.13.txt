FORTY-FIFTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA45.13 
Agenda  item  26.1  13  May 1992 
ASSESSMENT  OF NEW  MEMBERS  AND  ASSOCIATE  MEMBERS 
ASSESSMENTS  OF ARMENIA,  GEORGIA,  KYRGYZSTAN, 
MOLDOVA  AND  TAJIKISTAN 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  that Armenia,  Georgia,  Kyrgyzstan,  Moldova  and Tajikistan  became  Members  of the World 
Health  Organization  in late April  or early  May 1992; 
Noting  that the United  Nations  General  Assembly  has not yet established  assessment  rates  for Armenia, 
Kyrgyzstan,  Moldova  and Tajikistan,  which  are all Members  of the United  Nations,  but has decided  that, when 
determined,  these  rates  will be deducted  from  the rates  applicable  to the former  USSR; 
Noting  further  that Georgia  is not yet a Member  of the United  Nations  but that WHO  should  follow  the 
practice  adopted  by the United  Nations  for the other  States  which  were  republics  forming  part of the former 
USSR; 
Noting  that the contributions  payable  by these  Members  in 1992  would  in effect  constitute  budgetary 
income,  since  they would  be deducted  from  contributions  payable  by the former  USSR,  responsibility  for which 
has been  assumed  by the Russian  Federation; 
Recalling  the principle  established  in resolution  WHA8.5,  and confirmed  in resolution  WHA24.12,  that 
the latest  available  United  Nations  scale  of assessments  should  be used as a basis  for determining  the scale  of 
assessments  to be used by WHO; 
Recalling  further  that the Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly,  in resolution  WHA26.21,  affirmed  its 
belief  that the scale  of assessments  in WHO  should  follow  as closely  as possible  that of the United  Nations, 
DECIDES: 
(1) that  the WHO  assessment  rates  for Armenia,  Georgia,  Kyrgyzstan,  Moldova  and Tajikistan  for 
1992 shall be calculated  by the Director-General  on the basis  of the United  Nations  assessment  rates 
determined  by the United  Nations  General  Assembly; 
(2) that  assessments  for Armenia,  Georgia,  Kyrgyzstan,  Moldova  and Tajikistan  relating  to the year 
1992 shall be reduced  to one-third  of the WHO  assessment  rates  calculated  in accordance  with operative 
paragraph  (1) above; 
(3) that  assessment  rates  for Armenia,  Georgia,  Kyrgyzstan,  Moldova  and Tajikistan  and contributions 
payable  shall be deducted  from  those  applicable  to the former  USSR,  responsibility  for payment  of which 
has been  assumed  by the Russian  Federation;

(4) that,  notwithstanding  Financial  Regulation  7.1, the 1992  contributions  of Armenia,  Georgia, 
Kyrgyzstan,  Moldova  and Tajikistan  shall  be accounted  for as budgetary  income  upon  receipt; 
(5) that  the Director-General  shall  use the same  principles  as above  to calculate  the 1992  assessment 
rates of other  new Members  which  were  republics  forming  part of the former  USSR  and which  may join 
WHO  in 1992,  with appropriate  reductions  in their  assessment  rates  for 1992  depending  upon  their  date 
of admission  to membership.
