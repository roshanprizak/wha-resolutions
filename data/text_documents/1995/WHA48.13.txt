FORTY-EIGHTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA48.13 
Agenda  item  19 12  May  1995 
Communicable  diseases  prevention  and  control: 
new，emerging，and  re-emerging  infectious  diseases 
The Forty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on new,  emerging,  and re-emerging  infectious 
diseases;1 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA39.27  on rational  use of drugs,  WHA44.8  and WHA46.36  on tuberculosis, 
WHA45.35  on human  immunodeficiency  virus,  WHA46.31  on dengue  prevention  and control,  WHA46.32 
on malaria,  and WHA46.6  on emergency  and humanitarian  relief; 
Aware  that with  the increasing  global  population  many  are forced  to live under  conditions  of 
overcrowding,  inadequate  housing,  and poor  hygiene;  that  more  frequent  international  travel  leads  to rapid 
global  exchange  of human  pathogens;  that  changes  in health  technology  and food  production,  as well as its 
distribution  (including  international  trade)  and handling,  create  new opportunities  for human  pathogens;  that 
human  behavioural  changes  expose  large  segments  of the global  population  to diseases  not previously 
experienced;  that  expanding  areas  of human  habitation  expose  thousands  of people  to enzootic  pathogens 
previously  unknown  as causes  of human  disease;  and  that microbes  continue  to evolve  and adapt  to their 
environment,  leading  to the appearance  of new pathogens; 
Aware  also  of the continued  threat  of well-known  diseases  such  as influenza  and meningococcal 
infections,  and of tuberculosis,  cholera  and plague,  once  thought  to be conquered,  and the growing  danger 
of diseases  transmitted  by vectors  no longer  controlled,  such  as dengue  haemorrhagic  fever  and yellow  fever; 
Concerned  at the lack  of coordinated  global  surveillance  to monitor,  report  and respond  to new, 
emerging,  and re-emerging  infectious  diseases,  by the general  absence  of the diagnostic  capabilities  necessary 
to identify  accurately  pathogenic  microorganisms  and the insufficient  numbers  of trained  health  care 
professionals  to investigate  these  infectious  diseases; 
Alarmed  by the increasing  frequency  of antimicrobial  resistance  in bacterial  pathogens,  which  can make 
some  diseases  such  as tuberculosis  virtually  untreatable  with  currently  available  antibiotics,

RESOLUTION  OF  THE  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY 
RÉSOLUTION  DE  L'ASSEMBLÉE  MONDIALE  DE  LA  SANTÉ 
РЕЗОЛЮЦИЯ  ВСЕМИРНОЙ  АССАМБЛЕИ  ЗДРАВООХРАНЕНИЯ 
RESOLUCION  DE  LA  ASAMBLEA  MUNDIAL  DE  LA  SALUD 
1. URGES  Member  States: 
(1) to strengthen  national  and local  programmes  of active  surveillance  for infectious  diseases, 
ensuring  that efforts  are directed  to early  detection  of outbreaks  and prompt  identification  of nçw, 
emerging  and re-emerging  infectious  diseases; 
(2) to improve  routine  diagnostic  capabilities  for common  microbial  pathogens  so that outbreaks  due 
to infectious  diseases  may be more  easily  identified  and accurately  diagnosed; 
(3) to enhance,  and to participate  actively  in, communications  between  national  and international 
services  involved  in disease  detection,  early  notification,  surveillance,  control  and response; 
(4) to encourage  routine  testing  of antimicrobial  sensitivity,  and to foster  practices  for rational 
prescription,  availability  and administration  of antimicrobial  agents  in order  to limit  the development 
of resistance  in microbial  pathogens; 
(5) to increase  the number  of staff skilled  in both epidemiological  and laboratory  investigations  of 
infectious  diseases  and promotion  in such  specialization; 
(6) to foster  more  applied  research  in areas  such  as the development  of sensitive,  specific  and 
inexpensive  diagnostics,  the setting  of standards  for basic  public  health  procedures,  and the 
establishment  of fundamental  disease  prevention  strategies; 
(7) to control  outbreaks  and promote  accurate  and timely  reporting  of cases  at national  and 
international  levels; 
2. URGES  other  specialized  agencies  and organizations  of the United  Nations  system,  bilateral 
development  agencies,  nongovernmental  organizations  and other  groups  concerned  to increase  their 
cooperation  in the recognition,  prevention  and control  of new,  emerging  and re-emerging  infectious  diseases 
both through  continued  support  for general  social  and health  development  and through  specific  support  to 
national  and international  programmes  to recognize  and respond  to new, emerging,  and re-emerging  infectious 
diseases; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to establish,  in consultation  with Member  States,  strategies  to improve  recognition  and response 
to new,  emerging  and re-emerging  infectious  diseases  in a manner  sustainable  by all countries  and 
prompt  dissemination  of relevant  information  among  all Member  States; 
(2) to draw  up plans  for improved  national  and international  surveillance  of infectious  diseases  and 
their causative  agents,  including  accurate  laboratory  diagnosis  and prompt  dissemination  of case 
definition,  surveillance  information,  and to coordinate  their implementation  among  interested  Member 
States,  agencies  and other  groups; 
(3) to increase  WHO's  capacity,  within  available  resources,  for directing  and strengthening  applied 
research  for the prevention  and control  of these  diseases,  and to ensure  that reference  facilities  remain 
available  for safely  characterizing  new or unusual  pathogens; 
(4) to establish  strategies  enabling  rapid  national  and international  responses  to investigate  and to 
combat  infectious  disease  outbreaks  and epidemics  including  identifying  available  sources  of diagnostic, 
preventive  and therapeutic  products  meeting  relevant  international  standards.  Such  strategies  should 
involve  active  cooperation  and coordination  among  pertinent  organizational  programmes  and activities 
including  those  of the Global  Programme  for Vaccines,  the Action  Programme  on Essential  Drugs,  and 
the Division  of Drug  Management  and Policy; 
(5) to coordinate  WHO，s  initiative  on new,  emerging  and re-emerging  infectious  diseases  in 
cooperation  with other  specialized  agencies  and organizations  of the United  Nations  system,  bilateral 
development  agencies,  nongovernmental  organizations,  Member  States,  and other  groups  concerned; 
(6) to improve  programme  monitoring  and evaluation  at national,  regional  and global  levels; 
(7) to keep the Executive  Board  and the Health  Assembly  informed  of progress  in the implementation 
of this resolution.
