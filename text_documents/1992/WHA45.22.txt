FORTY-FIFTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY  WHA45.22 
Agenda  item  31 13  May 1992 
CHILD  HEALTH  AND  DEVELOPMENT: 
HEALTH  OF THE  NEWBORN 
The Forty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the Director-General's  report  on "Child  health  and development:  health  of the 
newborn"; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA31.55  and WHA32.42  on maternal  and child  health  and family  planning; 
Reaffirming  WHO，s  commitment  to the goals  of the World  Summit  for Children; 
Aware  that at least one-third  of the deaths  of children  under  five years  of age occur  during  the first 
month,  and most  frequently  the first week  of life, mainly  as a consequence  of the poor health  and nutrition 
status  of the mother  and the poor quality  of care she receives  before,  during  and after  delivery; 
Noting  that inadequate  attention  to the health  of the pregnant  woman  and the newborn  results  in 
markedly  increased  likelihood  of death,  ill-health  or disability  during  later infancy,  childhood  and even  adult 
life; 
Recognizing  that significant  improvements  in health  of the newborn  in all countries  could  be achieved  by 
integrating  safe motherhood  activities  with appropriate  care of the newborn;  namely  improving  maternal 
nutrition,  controlling  perinatal  infections,  adapting  resuscitation  and thermal  control  principles  to local 
circumstances,  and ensuring  that breast-feeding  starts  immediately  after  birth, 
1. URGES  all Member  States: 
(1) to train  those  providing  maternal  and child  health  care in the principles  and techniques  of risk 
screening  during  pregnancy，clean  and safe delivery,  resuscitation,  thermal  control  and breast-feeding; 
(2) to strengthen  their  monitoring  and surveillance  systems  for maternal  and perinatal  health  so that 
they provide  continuous  assessment  of problems  and progress  in terms  of coverage,  quality  of care and 
the attainment  of specific  targets; 
2. URGES  the Director-General: 
(1) to reinforce  his cooperation  with Member  States  in implementing  the measures  specified  above; 
(2) to ensure  that the Organization's  support  is provided  through  district-based  national  health 
programmes;

the area of research  on and development  of appropriate  technology; 
(4) to develop  and promote  the use of indicators  of the quality  of maternal  and neonatal  health  care; 
(5) to mobilize  additional  scientific  and financial  resources  for the measures  specified  in this 
resolution; 
(6) to keep  the Health  Assembly  informed  of progress  through  appropriate  mechanisms.
