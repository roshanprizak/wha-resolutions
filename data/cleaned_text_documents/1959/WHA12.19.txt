The Twelfth World Health Assembly, Having considered the question of periodicity of meetings of the Committee on International Quarantine, 1. ENDORSES the opinion of the Committee that for the present annual meetings should be continued but that in the future the time interval between meetings might be increased without jeopardizing the functioning of the International Sanitary Regulations, and that the Regulations for the Committee 3 should therefore not at present be amended; and 2. REQUESTS the Director-General to submit for review to the Committee on International Quarantine in 1961 the question of periodicity of its meetings, and to present the report and recommendations of the Committee to the Fifteenth World Health Assembly. Tenth plenary meeting, 26 May 1959 (section 3 of the second report of the Committee on Programme and Budget)
