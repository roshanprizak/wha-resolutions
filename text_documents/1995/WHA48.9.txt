FORTY-EIGHTH  WORLD  HEALTH  ASSEMBLY WHA48.9 
Agenda  item  18.2 12 May  1995 
Prevention  of hearing  impairment 
The Forty-eighth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  WHA38.19  on prevention  of hearing  impairment  and  deafness,  and WHA42.28 
on disability  prevention  and  rehabilitation; 
Concerned  at the growing  problem  of largely  preventable  hearing  impairment  in the world,  where  at present  120  million  people  are estimated  to have  disabling  hearing  difficulties; 
Recognizing  that  severe  hearing  impairment  in children  constitutes  a particularly  serious  obstacle  to optimal  development  and  education,  including  language  acquisition,  and  that  hearing  difficulties  leading  to communication  problems  are a major  subject  of concern  in the elderly  and  thus  one of growing  worldwide importance  in view  of the aging  of populations; 
Aware  of the significant  public  health  aspects  of avoidable  hearing  loss,  related  to causes  such  as 
congenital  disorders  and infectious  diseases,  as well  as use of ototoxic  drugs  and exposure  to excessive  noise; 
Noting  the persistent  inadequacy  of resources  for hearing  impairment  prevention,  despite  the increasing commitment  of international  nongovernmental  organizations, 
1. URGES  Member  States: 
(1) to  prepare  national  plans  for the prevention  and control  of major  causes  of avoidable  hearing  loss, 
and for early  detection  in babies,  toddlers,  and children,  as well  as in the elderly,  within  the framework 
of primary  health  care; 
(2) to  take  advantage  of existing  guidelines  and  regulations  or introduce  appropriate  legislation  for 
the proper  management  of particularly  important  causes  of deafness  and hearing  impairment,  such  as 
otitis  media,  use  of ototoxic  drugs  and  harmful  exposure  to noise,  including  noise  in the work 
environment  and  loud  music; 
(3) to  ensure  the highest  possible  coverage  of childhood  immunization  against  the target  diseases  of 
the Expanded  Programme  on Immunization  and against  mumps,  rubella  and (meningococcal)  meningitis 
whenever  possible; 
(4) to  consider  the setting-up  of mechanisms  for collaboration  with  nongovernmental  or other 
organizations  for support  to, and coordination  of, action  to prevent  hearing  impairment  at country  level, 
including  the detection  of hereditary  factors,  by genetic  counselling; 
WHA48.9 
(5) to  ensure  appropriate  public  information  and  education  for hearing  protection  and  conservation 
in particularly  vulnerable  or exposed  population  groups; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to  further  technical  cooperation  in the  prevention  of hearing  impairments,  including  the 
development  of appropriate  technical  guidelines; 
(2) to  assist  countries  in the assessment  of hearing  loss  as a public  health  problem; 
(3) to  support,  to the extent  that  resources  are available,  the planning,  implementation,  monitoring 
and evaluation  of measures  in countries  to prevent  hearing  impairment; 
(4) to  develop  further  collaboration  and  coordination  with  nongovernmental  and  other  interested 
organizations  and  institutions; 
(5) to  promote  and  support,  to the extent  feasible,  applied  and  operations  research  for the optimal 
prevention  and  treatment  of major  causes  of hearing  impairment; 
(6) to  mobilize  extrabudgetary  resources  to strengthen  technical  cooperation  in hearing  impairment 
prevention,  including  possible  support  from  organizations  concerned; 
(7) to  keep  the Executive  Board  and  the Health  Assembly  informed  of progress,  as appropriate.
