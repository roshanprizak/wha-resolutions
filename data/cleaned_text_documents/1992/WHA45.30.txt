The Forty-fifth World Health Assembly, Recalling resolutions WHA41.17 and WHA43.20; Having considered the report on the use of the WHO ethical criteria for medicinal drug promotion; Noting with concern that little information is available on any progress in controlling medicinal drug promotion through the use of the concepts embodied in the WHO ethical criteria; Noting that many drug regulatory authorities do not yet have the administrative resources to regulate drug promotion; Mindful that a high level of compliance and self-regulation by the pharmaceutical industry is necessary, 1. URGES Member States to intensify efforts to involve government agencies including drug regulatory authorities, aswell as pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors and the promotion industry, health personnel involved in the prescription, dispensing, supply and distribution of drugs, universities and other teaching institutionsprofessional associations, patient and consumer groups, and the professional and general media (including publishers and editors of medical journals and related publications), in the implementation of the principles embodied in the WHO ethical criteria on medicinal drug promotion; 2. REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to request the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) to convene a meeting of interested parties in collaboration with WHO to discuss possible approaches to further advancing the principles embodied in WHO's ethical criteria for medicinal drug promotion; (2) to consider other approaches and mechanisms in the Member States to improve the implementation of WHO's ethical criteria for medicinal drug promotion; (3) to report the outcome of the meeting of interested parties and other actions of the Organization relevant to this issue to the Forty-seventh World Health Assembly through the Executive Board.
