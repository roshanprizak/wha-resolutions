WHA2.63.  Reimbursement  by Governments  for Materials,  Supplies  and  Equipment 
The Second  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  reconsidered  paragraph  VI of the appropriation  resolution  for the financial 
year 1949  65 as approved  by the  First  World  Health  Assembly  ; and 
Recognizing  that  governments  receiving  advisory  and  demonstration  services 
from  the Organization  will  normally  contribute  a large  share  of the cost  of demonstration 
projects  by providing  for those  expenditures  of the  project  which  can  be met  in local 
currency  ; and 
Having  considered  that  the provisions  of paragraph  VI of the appropriation  resolution 
for the financial  year  1949  represent  a serious  obstacle  to providing  these  services  to 
some  of the  countries  where  the  greatest  need  exists, 
(1) RESOLVES  that  paragraph  VI of the appropriation  resolution  for the financial  year 
1949  be rescinded,  and  replaced  by the following  text  : 
" With  respect  to advisory  and  demonstration  services  to governments,  the DirectorGeneral  shall,  in consultation  with  the receiving  governments,  take  steps  to recover 
the depreciated  value  of non-expendable  equipment  which  may  be left in the country 
after  a demonstration  team  completes  its work  and  such  part  of the cost  of expendable 
materials  and  supplies  as the governments  are willing  to repay,  which  repayment 
may be made  by governments  in their  own  currencies.  The  Director-General, 
prior  tq the furnishing  of these  services,  should,  if possible,  reach  agreement  in advance 
as to the willingness  of governments  to make  such  payments  under  the provisions 
of this  paragraph  ", 
(2) REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to submit  a report  reviewing  this  policy  to the 
Fifth  World  Health  Assembly. 
(Fourth  report  of Committee  on Administration  and  Finance,  adopted  at 
tenth  plenary  meeting)
