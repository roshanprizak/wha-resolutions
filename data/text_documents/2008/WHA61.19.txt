Climate change and health 
 
The Sixty-first World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on climate change and health;1 
Recalling resolution WHA51.29 on the protection of  human health from risks related to climate 
change and stratospheric ozone de pletion and acknowledging and welcoming the work carried out so 
far by WHO in pursuit of it; 
Recognizing that, in the interim, the scientific  evidence of the effect of the increase in 
atmospheric greenhouse gases, and of the potential c onsequences for human health, has considerably 
improved; 
Noting with concern the recent findings of the In tergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that 
the effects of temperature increases on some aspects of  human health are already being observed; that 
the net global effect of projected climate change  on human health is expected to be negative, 
especially in developing countries, small island de veloping States and vulnerable local communities 
which have the least capacity to prep are for and adapt to such change,  and that exposure to projected 
climate change could  affect the health status of millions of  people, through increases in malnutrition, 
in death, disease and injury due to extreme weather ev ents, in the burden of diarrhoeal disease, in the 
frequency of cardiorespiratory diseases, and through altered distribution of some infectious disease 
vectors; 
Noting further that climate change could jeopardize achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals, including the health-related Goal s, and undermine the efforts of the Secretariat 
and Member States to improve public  health and reduce health inequalities globally; 
Recognizing the importance of addressing in a timely fashion the health impacts resulting from 
climate change due to the cumulative effects of  emissions of greenhouse gases, and further 
recognizing that solutions to the health impact s of climate change should be seen as a joint 
responsibility of all States and that developed c ountries should assist developing countries in this 
regard; 
Recognizing the need to assist Member States in  assessing the implications of climate change 
for health and health systems in their country, in identifying appropriate and comprehensive strategies 
and measures for addressing these implications, in bu ilding capacity in the health sector to do so and

2 in working with government and nongovernmental partne rs to raise awareness of the health impacts of 
climate change in their country and take action to address them;  
Further recognizing that strengthening health system s to enable them to deal with both gradual 
changes and sudden shocks is a f undamental priority in terms of addressing the direct and indirect 
effects of climate change for health,  
1. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to continue to draw to the attention of the public and policy-makers the serious risk of 
climate change to global health and to the achievement of the health-related Millennium 
Development Goals, and to work with FAO, WMO, UNDP, UNEP, the  United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change secretar iat, and other appropriate organizations of 
the United Nations, in the context of United Na tions reform initiatives, and with national and 
international agencies, to ensure  that these health impacts and their resource implications are 
understood and can be taken into account in fu rther developing national and international 
responses to climate change; 
(2) to engage actively in the UNFCCC Nairobi  Work Programme on Impacts, Vulnerability 
and Adaptation to Climate Change, in order to en sure its relevance to the health sector, and to 
keep Member States informed about the work  programme in order to facilitate their 
participation in it as appropriate and ac cess to the benefits of its outputs; 
(3) to work on promoting consideration of the health impacts of climate change by the 
relevant United Nations bodies in order to help developing countries to address the health 
impacts of climate change; 
(4) to continue close cooperation with Me mber States and appropriate United Nations 
organizations, other agencies and funding bodies in  order to develop capacity to assess the risks 
from climate change for human health and to  implement effective response measures, by 
promoting further research and pilot projects in this area, including work on: 
(a) health vulnerability to climate ch ange and the scale and nature thereof;  
(b) health protection strategies and measur es relating to climate change and their 
effectiveness, including cost-effectiveness; 
(c) the health impacts of potential adapta tion and mitigation measures in other sectors 
such as marine life, water resources, land use, and transport, in particular where these could have positive benefits for health protection; 
(d) decision-support and other tools, such  as surveillance and monitoring, for assessing 
vulnerability and health impacts a nd targeting measures appropriately; 
(e) assessment of the likely financial costs and other resources necessary for health 
protection from climate change; 
(5) to consult Member States on the preparation of a workplan for scaling up WHOâ€™s 
technical support to Member States for assessing and addressing the implications of climate 
change for health and health systems, in cluding practical tools and methodologies and   WHA61.19 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  mechanisms for facilitating exchange of informa tion and best practice and coordination between 
Member States, and to present a draft workplan to the Executive Board at its  124th session; 
2. URGES Member States: 
(1) to develop health measures and integrate th em into plans for adaptation to climate change 
as appropriate; 
(2) to build the capacity of public health lead ers to be proactive in providing technical 
guidance on health issues, be competent in  developing and implementing strategies for 
addressing the effects of, and adapting to, climate change, and show leadership in supporting the 
necessary rapid and comprehensive action;  
(3) to strengthen the capacity of health syst ems for monitoring and minimizing the public 
health impacts of climate change through ade quate preventive measures, preparedness, timely 
response and effective management of natural disasters; 
(4) to promote effective engagement of the hea lth sector and its collaboration with all related 
sectors, agencies and key partners at national and gl obal levels in order to reduce the current and 
projected health risks from climate change; 
(5) to express commitment to meeting the cha llenges posed to human health by climate 
change, and to provide clear dir ections for planning actions and investments at the national level 
in order to address the health effects of climate changes.
