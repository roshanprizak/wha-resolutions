The Fifty-fifth World Health Assembly, Underlining that the World Health Organization focuses on the possible public health consequences of an incident involving biological and chemical agents and radionuclear material, regardless of whether it is characterized as a natural occurrence, accidental release ora deliberate act; Having reviewed the report on the deliberate use of biological and chemical agents to cause harm: public health response;1 Seriously concerned about threats against civilian populations, including those caused by natural occurrence or accidental release of biological or chemical agents or radionuclear material aswell as their deliberate use to cause illness and deathin target populations; Noting that such agents can be disseminated through a range of mech anisms, including the food- and water-supply chains, thereby threatening the integrity of public health systems; Acknowledging that natural occurrence or accidental release of biological, chemical agents and radionuclear material could have serious global public health implications and jeopardise the public health achievements of the past decades; Acknowledging also that the local release of biol ogical, chemical and radionuclear material designed to cause harm could have serious global public health implications and jeopardize the public health achievements of the past decades; Recalling resolution WHA54.14 on global health security: epidemic alert and response, which stresses the need for all Member St ates to work together, with WHO and with other technical partners, in addressing health emergencies of international concern, and resolution WHA45.32 on the International Programme on Chemical Safety, which emphasized the need to establish or strengthen national and local capacities to respond to chemical incidents; 1 Document A55 / 20. WHA55.16 2 Recognizing that one of the most effective met hods of preparing for deliberately caused disease is to strengthen public health surveillance and response activities for naturally or accidentally occurring diseases, 1. URGES Member States: (1) to ensure they have in place national di sease-surveillance plans which are complementary to regional and global disease-surveillance mechanis ms, and to collaborate in the rapid analysis and sharing of surveillance data of international humanitarian concern; (2) to collaborate and provide mutual support in order to enhance national capacity infield epidemiology, laboratory diagnoses, toxicology and case management; (3) to treat any deliberate use, including local, of biological and chemical agents and radionuclear attack to cause harm also as a global public health threat, and to respond to such a threat in other countries by sharing expertise, supplies and resources in order rapidly to contain the event and mitigate its effects; 2. REQUESTS the Director-General: (1) to continue, in consultation with relevant intergovernmental agencies and other international organizations, to strengthen global surveillance of infectious diseases, water quality, and food safety, and related activities such as revision of the International Health Regulations and development of WHOs food safety strategy, by coordinating information gathering on potential health risks and disease out breaks, data verification, analysis and dissemination, by providing support to laboratory networks, and by making a strong contribution to any international humanitarian response, as required; (2) to provide tools and support for Member St ates, particularly developing countries, in strengthening their national health systems, notably with regard to emergency preparedness and response plans, including disease surveillance and toxicology, risk communication, and psychosocial consequences of emergencies; (3) to continue to issue international guidance and technical information on recommended public health measures to deal with the deliberate use of biological and chemical agents to cause harm, and to make this information available on WHOs web site; (4) to examine the possible development of new tools, within the mandate of WHO, including modelling of possible scenarios of natural occurrence, accidental release or deliberate use of biological, chemical agents and radionucl ear material that affect health, and collective mechanisms concerning the global public health response to contain or mitigate the effects of natural occurrence, accidental release or deliberate use of biological, chemical agents and radionuclear material that affect health.
