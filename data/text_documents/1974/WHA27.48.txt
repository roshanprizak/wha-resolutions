The Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA26.60  and  EB53.R46; 
Noting  with  deep  concern  that  the health  situation  in the African  countries  stricken  by drought  has  not 
only  deteriorated  but  that  the problem  has  spread  to other  regions; 
Aware  of the urgent  needs  created  by the drought  in the Sudano-  Sahelian  zone  of Africa  and  by other 
natural  calamities  that  have  occurred  elsewhere, 
1. NOTES  with  satisfaction  the information  provided  by the Director-General  and  the  Regional  Director 
for Africa  on the health  assistance  already  rendered  to the affected  countries,  in close  cooperation  with  the 
governments  concerned,  the Secretary-General  of the United  Nations,  the Director-General  of F AO and  the 
other  United  Nations  bodies  and  agencies; 
2. EXPRESSES  its gratitude  to all the Member  States  which  have  responded  generously  to the appeal  of the 
United  Nations  Secretary-General  and  the Director-General  of F AO to combat  the persistent  effects  of the 
drought  and  further  the medium-term  and  long-term  development  of the infrastructures; 
3. THANKS  the Director-General  of FAO  for his activities  in coordinating  assistance  and  for his continuing 
cooperation  with  WHO  in meeting  the urgent  health  needs  of the African  countries; 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to draw  the attention  of Member  States  to the deterioration  of the health  situation  in the African 
countries  stricken  by the drought  and  to the need  for still  more  vigorous  action  for combating  the health 
consequences  which  persist  and  will  persist  long  after  the drought  has  ended; 
(2) to step  up WHO  assistance  to the affected  countries,  over  and  above  the  health  programmes  in 
process  of implementation  in those  countries  ； 
(3) to take  such  steps  as will  enable  WHO  to meet  more  readily  the urgent  needs  of countries  stricken 
by disasters  or natural  catastrophes  ； and 
(4) to report  to the fifty-fifth  session  of the  Executive  Board  and  the  Twenty-eighth  World  Health 
Assembly  on the progress  achieved  in this  area.
