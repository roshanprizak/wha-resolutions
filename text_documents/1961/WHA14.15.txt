WHA14.15  Financing  of the  Malaria  Eradication  Programme 
The Fourteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  reappraised  the  financial  situation  of the Malaria  Eradication  Special  Account  in the light 
of a report  by the Director-General  pursuant  to resolution  WHA13.45  of the Thirteenth  World  Health 
Assembly; 
Having  considered  a report  by the Director-General  on possible  methods  of ensuring  the  financing 
of the planned  malaria  eradication  programme  in 1962  and  future  years; 
Considering  that  voluntary  contributions  to the Malaria  Eradication  Special  Account  have  not  been 
forthcoming  in sufficient  amounts; 
Believing  that  it is desirable  that  the  financing  of the  costs  of the  field  programmes  should 
be incorporated  into  the  regular  budget  by stages;  and 
Taking  into  account  the  fact  that  the  Members  of the Organization  which  are  engaged  in malaria 
programmes  are  already  expending  large  sums  for this  purpose, 
1. DECIDES  that  the costs  of the malaria  eradication  field  programme  shall  be incorporated  in the regular 
budget  by stages  over  a three-year  period  in the following  manner: 
(1) an  amount  of $2 000  000  shall  be added  to the effective  working  budget  for 1962  to help  finance 
the malaria  eradication  field  programme; 
(2) the  Director-General  is requested  to include  in his proposed  programme  and  budget  estimates 
for 1963  an amount  of $4 000  000  to help  finance  the  malaria  eradication  field  programme; 
(3) the  Director-General  is requested  to include  in his proposed  programme  and  budget  estimates 
for 1964  and  future  years  the full  costs  of the malaria  eradication  field  programme; 
2. DECIDES  further,  as a transitional  measure  to preclude  placing  too heavy  a burden  on countries  carrying 
out malaria  programmes,  that 
(1) all  active  Members  carrying  out  malaria  programmes, 
(a) whose  assessments  are 0.50  per cent,  or less,  or 
(è) whose  per  capita  income  is low, 
shall  be eligible  in 1962  for credits  of 75 per cent,  towards  the payments  for their  share  of the $2 000  000 
provided  in paragraph  1 (1) above; 
(2) the  Members  eligible  for credits  shall  be determined  by the Health  Assembly  in a schedule  to be 
attached  to the  Appropriation  Resolution; 
(3) the  credits  referred  to herein  shall  be covered  by the cash  balance  available  in the Malaria  Eradication  Special  Account; 
3. RECOMMENDS  to the Fifteenth  and  Sixteenth  World  Health  Assemblies  that  credits  as defined  in paragraph  2 above  should  be provided  as follows: 
1963  — 50 per  cent. 1964  — 25 per  cent.
