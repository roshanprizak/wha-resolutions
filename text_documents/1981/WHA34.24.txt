22 May 1981 
THE MEANING OF WHO'S INTERNATIONAL  HEALTH WORK THROUGH COORDINATION 
AND TECHNICAL  COOPERATION 
The Thirty-fourth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  previous  resolutions  of the Health Assembly,  and in particular  resolutions 
WHA23.59  on certain important  constitutional  functions  of WHO; WHA28.75  and WHA.28.76  on 
technical  assistance;  WHA.29,48,  WHA30.30,  WHA31.41  and WHA32.27  on technical  cooperation, 
technical  cooperation  among developing  countries,  and related programme  budget policy; 
WHA32.24  on coordination  for health,  socioeconomic  development  and peace；  and WHA30.43, 
WHA32.30  and WHA33.24  on policies  and strategies  for the attainment  by all the people of the 
world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially  and 
economically  productive  life; 
Resolved to strengthen  further cooperation  among Member States,  being guided by the 
Constitution  of WHO for the attainment  by all peoples of the highest possible  level of health， 
by the Declaration  and recommendations  of Alma-Ata  on primary health care as the key to the 
attainment  of health for all, and by resolution  34/58 of the United Nations General Assembly 
on health as an integral  part of development； 
Resolutely  determined  to fulfil the constitutional  functions  of WHO as the directing  and 
coordinating  authority  on international  health work through the collective  action of its 
Member States,  and through ensuring  technical  cooperation  with its Member States at their 
request; 
Welcoming  the changed climate  in WHO and among its Member States which has given rise 
to the rejection  of the concept of "technical  assistance",  whereby aid was provided  by socalled "donors"  to "recipients",  and its rep lacement  by the concept of "technical  cooperation" 
founded on common and mutual interest  of all, whereby Member States cooperate  with their 
Organization,  as equal partners,  to define and achieve their health goals through programmes 
that are determined  by their needs and priorities  and that promote their self-reliance  in 
health development； 
1. REITERATES  that WHO'S unique constitutional  role in international  health work comprises 
in essence the inseparable  and mutually  supportive  functions  of acting as the directing  and 
coordinating  authority  on international  health work and ensuring  technical  cooperation  between 
WHO and its Member States,  essential  for the attainment  of health for all by the year 2000, 
making no distinction  between these integral  functions  carried out at country,  regional  and 
global levels,  whether financed  from the WHO regular budget or from other sources； 
2. AFFIRMS  that: 
(1) coordination  in international  health work is the facilitation  of the collective 
action of Member States and WHO to identify  health problems  throughout  the world, to 
formulate  policies  for solving them, and to define principles  and develop strategies  for 
giving effect to these policies； 
(2) technical  cooperation  in international  health work is joint action of Member States 
cooperating  among themselves  and with WHO, as well as with other relevant  agencies，  to 
achieve their common goal of the attainment  by all people of the highest possible  level of 
health by implementing  the policies  and strategies  they have defined collectively; 
3. CONSIDERS  further  that technical  cooperation  in international  health work must be 
characterized  by: 
(1) equal partnership  among cooperating  parties,  developing  and developed  countries 
alike, WHO and other intergovernmental,  bilateral,  multilateral  and nongovernmental 
organizations  participating  in technical  cooperation; 
(2) respect  for the sovereign  right of every country  to develop its national  health 
system and services  in the way that it finds most rational  and appropriate  to its needs; 
to mobilize  and use all internal  as well as bilateral  and other resources  to this end; 
and, for this purpose,  to make use of scientific,  technical,  human, material,  information 
and other support  provided  by WHO and other partners  in health development； 
(3) mutual responsibility  of cooperating  parties  for carrying  out jointly  agreed 
decisions  and obligations,  exchanging  experience  and evaluating  results  obtained,  both 
positive  and negative,  and making the information  thus generated  available  for the use 
and benefit  of all; 
STRESSES  the responsibility  of WHO to fulfil its constitutional  leadership  role as the 
directing  and coordinating  authority  in international  health work, including  research 
promotion  and development；  the application  of science  and technology  for health;  policy 
formulation;  the development  of worldwide  health programmes  for the promotion  of health, 
prevention,  control  and diagnosis  of disease,  rehabilitation  and strengthening  of health 
systems ； the provision  of valid information  on health matters  ； the fostering  of mechanisms 
for technical  cooperation  and coordination  in health work; the mobilization  and rationalization of the flow of health resources；  the contribution  of health to socioeconomic 
development  and peace；  and the provision  of necessary  support  for the development  of policies, 
strategies  and plans of action at country,  regional,  interregional  and global levels,  including 
joint action with other relevant  international  organizations； 
5. URGES Member States: 
(1) to act collectively  in order to ensure the most effective  fulfilment  by WHO of its 
constitutional  functions  and the formulation  by the Organization  of appropriate 
international  health policies,  arid principles  and programmes  to implement  these policies； 
(2) to formulate  their requests  for technical  cooperation  with WHO in the spirit of the 
policies,  principles  and programmes  they have adopted collectively  in WHO; 
(3) to take full account of the experiences  of technical  cooperation  between  WHO and 
its Member States when deciding  collectively  on policies,  principles  and programmes  in WHO; 
6. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board to ensure that the Organization1  s general programmes  of work, 
medium-term  programmes  and programme  budgets  fully reflect WHO's international  health work as 
a properly  balanced  and mutually  reinforcing  combination  of the Organization's  constitutional 
functions  of coordination  and technical  cooperation; 
7. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to emphasize  WHO'S unique constitutional  role in international  health work in all 
appropriate  forums,  and particularly  in the United Nations  system and other international 
and bilateral  organizations； 
(2) to report to the Board on any difficulties  encountered  in implementing  this 
resolution  and, in particular,  in gaining acceptance  of the concept of WHO'S international 
health work as described  in the resolution; 
8. INVITES  the United Nations  organizations  concerned,  as well as other international 
and bilateral  organizations  and collaborating  centres  and institutions,  to coordinate  with 
and support  the efforts of WHO by appropriate  actions  within their respective  spheres  of 
competence  in the spirit of resolution  34/58 of the United Nations  General  Assembly  on health 
as an integral  part of development,  and in so doing to adhere to the principles  of technical 
cooperation  and coordination  in international  health work set forth in this resolution.
