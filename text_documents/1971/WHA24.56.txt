WHA24.56  Quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of drugs 
The Twenty-fourth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  previous  Assembly  resolutions  dealing  with  pharmacology  and  the  control  of drugs,  and  in 
particular  resolutions  WHA16.36,  WHA17.39,  WHA20.34,  WHA21.37,  WHA22.50,  WHA23.13,  WHA23.42 
and WHA23.48; 
Convinced  that  matters  relating  to the discovery,  production  and  distribution  of drugs,  to the control 
of drug  quality,  safety  and efficacy  and to the monitoring  of adverse  reactions,  including  dependence-producing 
properties,  should  be looked  upon  as a whole; 
Realizing  that  the continuous  development  of medical  science  and  of the pharmaceutical  industry  leads 
to the appearance  of new  and  more  effective  drugs; 
Being  aware  of the increasing  need  for the prescribing  physician  to know  and  fully  understand  the effects, 
side-reactions  and  possible  interactions  of drugs; 
Considering  the responsibility  of the World  Health  Organization  to assist  in keeping  the national  health 
authorities  and  the medical  profession  abreast  of such  developments  through  expanded  facilities  for information on pharmacotherapy  and  for continuing  education  in clinical  pharmacology;  and 
Further  considering  the necessity  of devising  the most  efficient  ways  for the Organization  to carry  out 
this responsibility, 
1. COMMENDS  the increased  emphasis  in the programme  of the Organization,  and  the work  being  done,  on 
pharmacology  and  on the  control  of drugs; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General,  keeping  in mind  the need  for an overall  approach  to such  matters,  to 
study  how  best  the Organization  can  cope  with  its obligations  in this  domain  and  expand  its activities  as 
required,  and  to report  thereon  to the Executive  Board  at its forty-ninth  session  and  to the  Twenty-fifth 
World  Health  Assembly; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to consider  the creation  of a system  of collection  and  dissemination  of 
information  on results  of safety  and  effectiveness  trials  of new  drugs  and  on their  registration  in countries 
having  the necessary  facilities,  for possible  use of these  data  by the health  authorities  of countries  importing 
pharmaceutical  products;  and  to report  on the feasibility  and  financial  implications  of such  a system  to the 
forty-ninth  session  of the Executive  Board  and  to the Twenty-fifth  World  Health  Assembly;  and 
4. FURTHER  REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to publish  a list  of countries  where  the  State  authorities 
responsible  for the quality  control  of drugs  recognize  and  implement  the requirements  for " Good  Practices 
in the Manufacture  and  Quality  Control  of Drugs  " and  the certification  scheme  on the quality  of pharmaceutical products  moving  in international  commerce  as recommended  by the  Twenty-second  World  Health 
Assembly  in its resolution  WHA22.50.
