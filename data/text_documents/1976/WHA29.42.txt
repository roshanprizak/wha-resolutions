2. ENCOURAGES  Member  States  experiencing  reductions  in the  expenditure  level  of UNDP  assistance  to 
make  special  temporary  arrangements  through  their  health  administrations  to mitigate  major  disruptive 
effects  that  the current  financial  situation  of UNDP  may  have  on the ongoing  internationally-assisted  health 
programme  in their  countries  through  recourse  to such  measures  as partial  self-financing  or cost-sharing, 
enlarged  use  of national  staff  and  institutions,  and  judicious  reprogramming  with  other  available  sources 
of funds; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to continue  his full  collaboration  with  the Administrator  of UNDP  in 
order  to ensure  a systematic  consultation  at all levels  between  the governments  concerned,  UNDP  and  WHO 
with  a view  to safeguarding  essential  projects  and  components  in the programme  of health  and  related  fields;
