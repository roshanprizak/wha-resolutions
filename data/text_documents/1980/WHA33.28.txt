Strengthening  WHO'S  health  legislation  programme 
The Thirty-third  World  Health  Assembly,

level  to the  attainment  of health  for  all; 
Noting  that  appropriate  health  legislation  is an essential  component  of health  care 
services  and  environmental  health  systems  for  the  delivery  of both  personal  and  environmental 
health  services; 
Having  considered  the  report  of the  Director-General  on the  strengthening  of WHO's  health 
legislation  programme^-  and  the  comments  of the  Executive  Board  thereon;  ^ 
1. CONSIDERS  that  the  proposed  reorientation  of the  health  legislation  programme,  in 
pursuance  of resolution  WHA30.44,  fully  reflects  the  new  health  policies  of WHO  and  its 
Member  States; 
2, REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to proceed  with  the  formulation  of a detailed  programme 
of technical  cooperation  and  information  transfer  in health  legislation,  on the  basis  of the
