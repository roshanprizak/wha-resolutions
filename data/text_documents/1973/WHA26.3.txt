The Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly,

Conscious  of the contribution  being  made  by the Organization  to such  progress,  in fulfilment  of the aims

Recognizing  with  concern  that,  in spite  of the progress  achieved,  many  formidable  tasks  remain  to be 
accomplished  by the Organization  before  the objective  of the highest  possible  level  of health  is attained  by 
all peoples, 
1. EMPHASIZES  that  health  is the common  responsibility  of all people  and  that  major  world  health  problems 
cannot  be solved  without  full  international  cooperation; 
2. APPEALS  to Members  and  Associate  Members  to endeavour  to provide  the  highest  attainable  standard 
of health,  which  they  have  recognized  as a fundamental  right  of every  human  being,  and  to continue  to give 
the World  Health  Organization  the moral  support  and  material  aid that  they  have  given  it in the past; 
3. CALLS  UPON  all countries  to maintain  or increase  their  cooperative  efforts  within  the  extent  of their 
resources  with  a view  to improving  the health  and  health  services  of the world  ï¼› 
4. CONSIDERS  that  the  role  of the World  Health  Organization  in A world  where  countries  are  becoming 
increasingly  interdependent  is of crucial  importance;  and 
5. EXPRESSES  its gratitude  to all those  who  have  contributed  to the establishment  and  development  of the 
World  Health  Organization  as a unique  instrument  for  the cooperation  of all peoples  in the improvement 
of health  in the  world.
