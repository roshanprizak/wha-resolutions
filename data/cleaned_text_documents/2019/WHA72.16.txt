The Sevent y-second World Health Assembly, Having considered the report on emergency care systems for universal health coverage: ensuring timely care for the acutely ill and injured;1 Noting the importance of the organization of the health system as a whol e, including by distinguishing between elective services and care, non-elective services and care, and emergency services and care in order to address the health needs of populations in a sustainable, effective and appropriate manner; Recognizing that many proven health interventions are time-dependent and that emergency care is an integrated platform for delivering accessible, quality and time-sensitive health care services for acute illness and injury across the life course; Emphasizing that timeliness is an essential component of quality, and that millions of deaths and long-term disabilities from injuries, infections, mental disorders and other mental health conditions, acute exacerbations of noncommunicable diseases, acute complications of pregnancy, and other emergency conditions could be prevented each year if emergency care services exist and patients reach them in time; Noting that injury alone accounts for nearly 5 million deaths per year and that road traffic injury is the top killer of all those in the age group of 5 29 years;2 Noting also that emergency care is an essential part of health service delivery in health systems, and that well-designed emergency services facilitate timely recognition, treatment management and, when needed, continued treatment of the acutely ill at the appropriate level of the health system; Acknowledging Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), and recognizing that well-organized, safe and high-quality emergency reis akey mechanism for achieving a range of associated targets including those on universal health coverage, road safety, maternal and child health, noncommunicable diseases, mental health, and infectious disease; 1 Document A72 / 31. 2 Global Health Estimates 2016: deaths by cause, age, sex, by country and by region, 2000 2016. Geneva, World Health Organization; 2018 WHA 72.16 2 Acknowledging further Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable) and Goal 16 (Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, promote access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels), and noting that a strong and well-prepared everyday emergency care system is vital for mitigating the impact of disasters and mass casualty events and for maintaining delivery of health services in fragile situations and conflict-affected areas; Recalling resolutions WHA56.24 (2003) on implementing the recommendations of the World report on violence and health , WHA57.10 (2004) on road safety and health (echoed by United Nations General Assembly resolution 72 / 271 (2018) on improving global road safety), WHA60.22 (2007) on health systems: emergency-care systems, WHA64.10 (2011) on strengthening national health emergency and disaster management capacities and resilience of health systems, WHA66.8 (2013) on the comprehensive global mental health action plan 2013 2020, WHA68.15 (2015) on strengthening emergency and essential surgical care and anaesthesia as a component of universal health coverage, and WHA69.1 (2016) on strengthening essential public health functions in support of the achievement of universal health coverage, in which the Health Assembly prioritized integrated service-delivery models and identified the lack of access to timely emergency care as a cause of extensive and serious public health problems; Recalling also the mandate of WHOs Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019 2023 to improve integrated service delivery and to serve in particular the most disadvantaged, marginalized and hard-to-reach populations, to ensure that no one is left behind;1 Noting that providing non-discriminatory access to all people in need of timely care in well organized, safe and high-quality emergency care services can contribute to the reduction of health inequalities; Noting further that in many countries the emergency care system serves as the major health system safety net and the primary point of access to health services, in particular for marginalized populations, which is notan optimal use of health system resources; Recognizing that the lack of organized emergency care in many countries leads to wide global discrepancies in outcomes across the range of emergency conditions; Noting that many emergency care interventions are both effective and cost effective, and that integrated emergency care delivery can save lives and maximize impact across the health system; Concerned that the lack of investment in frontline emergency care is compromising effectiveness, limiting impact and increasing cost in other parts of the health system; Acknowledging that frontline health workers, nur ses in particular, provide care for the acutely ill and injured, often without the benefit of dedicated training in the management of emergency conditions, and with limited possibilities for consultations; 1 Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019 2023. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2018; as contained in document A71 / 4-en.pdf?ua=1or , accessed 19 March 2019) and adopted in resolution WHA71.1 (2018). WHA 72.16 3 Noting that improving outcomes requires an understanding of the potential and actual utilization of emergency care, and that existing data do not provide adequate support for effective planning and resource allocation for emergency care; Considering that WHO has a range of guidance that allows policy-make rs, planners and administrators to develop action plans that are best suited to their national contexts, along with resources for training, aswell as standards for essential emergency care services and resources at each level of the health system, 1.
