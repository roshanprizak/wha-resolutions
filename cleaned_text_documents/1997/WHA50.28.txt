n The Fiftieth World Health Assembly, Recalling resolution WHA48.16, which requests the Director-General to take the necessary steps for renewing the health-for-all strategy together with its indicators, by developing anew holistic global health policy based on the concepts of equity and solidarity, emphasizing the individual's, the family's and the community's responsibility for health, and placing health within the overall development framework; Recognizing that the new global health policy should be based on an intensive consultation process with Member States, and ona practical and socially feasible approach with a view to achieving equity, solidarity, effectiveness and efficiency, paying attention to the rational use of resources; Recognizing that the attainment of health is greatly influenced by environmental, social, economic and demographic factors which often lie outside the domain of the health sector, and that whereas the link between poverty and ill-health is well established, the fact that rapid urbanization, population movements and environmental degradation are all also likely to contribute to the future burden of disease is less well recognized; Aware that more realistic targets are required that take into account the social and economic situation of each region; Anticipating that the renewed health-for-all strategy will concentrate on improving life expectancy and the overall perceived quality of life, reducing morbidity and disability associated with ageing; Thanking the Director-General for the progress made, 1. PROPOSES that the renewed health-for-all strategy, when adopted, taking into account regional differences and respecting cultural values should: (1) inspire and guide health programme priorities nationally, regionally and globally; (2) become the principal guiding framework for the translation of WHO's constitutional mandate into the development of the Tenth General Programme of Work, strategic budgeting and evaluation; WHA50.28 2. URGES all Member States: (1) to ensure that future health policies include a commitment to equity, "gender sensitivity" and sustainability for future generations, and that implementation of such policies takes into account scientific progress and cultural values and is guided by reliable data and valid assessments to ensure the achievement of objectives; (2) to make the necessary changes in health services with special emphasis on prevention, including the control of communicable diseases; (3) to develop and implement integrated strategies, when adopted, for health, focusing on intersectoral initiatives, cost-effectiveness, accessibility, quality and sustainability of health systems; the use of existing, appropriate and affordable new technology; and the use of initiatives based on scientific knowledge or practical evidence; 3. REQUESTS the Director-General : (1) touse the renewed health-for-all strategy to enhance WHO's leadership in global health matters; (2) to continue the preparation of the Tenth General Programme of Work, which should clearly and concisely setout strategic priorities and targets for WHO and should be subject to periodic evaluation. The Tenth General Programme of Work should be derived from and be closely linked to the new policy for health for all for the twenty-first century; (3) to link the preparation of subsequent general programmes of work to the evaluation of the healthfor-all policy, taking account of social, economic and health developments; (4) to ensure that priorities and targets of the Tenth and subsequent General Programmes of Work are reflected in development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of programme budgets; (5) to optimize the management and use of WHO's human resources to enhance efficiency.
