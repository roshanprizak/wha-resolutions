WHA5.53  Salary  Differential 
The Fifth  World  Health  Assembly 
1. REAFFIRMS  the desirability  of securing  uniformity,  in so far as is possible,  in the practices  of the United Nations  and  of the  specialized  agencies  with  regard  to cost-of-living  adjustments  for internationally recruited  staff; 
2. EXPRESSES  the hope  that  a workable  system  of salary  differentials  which  will  equitably  and  properly adjust  the salaries  of employees  of the United  Nations  and  specialized  agencies  on a uniform  basis  from locality  to locality,  to account  for differences  in living  costs  and  other  pertinent  considerations,  will  be worked  out  by the United  Nations  and  the  specialized  agencies  ; 
3 LOOKS  FORWARD  to the consideration  of such  a system  by the General  Assembly  of the United  Nations at its session  in 1952  and  by the Sixth  World  Health  Assembly.
