the regular programme budget resulting from differences between the WHO budgetary rate of 
exchange and the United Nations/wHO accounting rates of exchange with respect to the US dollar/ 
Swiss franc relationship prevailing during that financial year, provided that such charges 
against casual income shall not exceed US$ 15 000 000 in 1979;
2 . REQUESTS the Director-General, notwithstanding the provisions of Financial 
Regulation 4.1 and the terms of the Appropriation Resolution for the financial year 1979, to 
transfer to casual income the net savings under the regular programme budget resulting from

rates of excKange with respect to the US dollar/Swiss franc relationship prevailing daring

which may affect the implementation of the regular programme budget, such transfers to casual 
income need not exceed US$ 15 000 000 in 1979;
3. FURTHER REQUESTS the Director-General to report such charges or transfers in the
