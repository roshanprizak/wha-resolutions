WHA3.11  Non-Proprietary  Names  for Drugs 
The Third  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  the desirability  that  a system  of non-proprietary  names  be established  internationally  for such new  pharmaceutical  products  as might  be contemplated  for later  insertion  in the Pharmacopoea  Inter-nationalis, 
1. APPROVES  the  general  principles  enumerated  by  the  Expert  Committee  on  the  Unification  of Pharmacopoeias  at its fifth  session,12  and 
2. RESOLVES  as follows  : 
(1) the  Expert  Committee  on the Unification  of Pharmacopoeias  should  undertake  the selection  and approval  of non-proprietary  names  for  drugs  which  might  be described  in later  editions  of the Pharmacopoea  Internationalis  ; 
(2) such  names  as are from  time  to time  selected  and  approved  by the expert  committee  should  be communicated  by the Director-General  to national  pharmacopoeial  authorities,  together  with  a recom-mendation  that  these  names  be officially  recognized  and  approved,  and,  if the substances  are eventually included  in the national  pharmacopoeia,  adopted  as pharmacopoeial  names  ; 
(3) such  recommendations  shall  further  include  a request  that  such  measures  as may  be deemed appropriate  by Member  States  be taken  with  a view  to preventing  the use of the names  selected  for unauthorized  purposes,  and  in particular  to prevent  the granting  of exclusive  proprietary  rights  in these names  to the manufacturer. (Third  report  of the Committee  on Programme,  adopted at sixth  plenary  meeting,  19 May  1950)  [A3/R/27]
