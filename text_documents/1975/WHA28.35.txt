Recalling  resolution  WHA27.42  on the health  conditions  of the refugees  and  displaced  persons  in the 
Middle  East  as well  as the population  of the occupied  territories, 
A 
Having  considered  the  Director-General's  report  on the  health  assistance  to refugees  and  displaced 
persons  in the Middle  East; 
Mindful  of the principle  that  the  health  of all peoples  is fundamental  to the attainment  of peace  and 
security; 
Considering  that  Israel's  deliberate  destruction  and  devastation  of refugee  camps,  cities  and  towns, 
such  as the destruction  by Israel  of the town  of Quneitra,  gravely  affect  the physical  and  mental  health  of 
their  inhabitants; 
Deeply  alarmed  by the deterioration  of health  and  living  conditions  of the Palestinian  refugees,  the displaced  persons  and  the population  of the occupied  territories, 
1. CALLS  UPON  Israel  to immediately  implement  the relevant  United  Nations  and  World  Health  Assembly 
resolutions  calling  for the immediate  return  of the Palestinian  refugees  and  displaced  persons  to their  homes 
as well  as the full  implementation  of the Fourth  Geneva  Convention  Relative  to the Protection  of Civilian 
Persons  in Time  of War,  of August  1949; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to allocate  appropriate  funds  to be devoted  to the improvement  of the 
health  conditions  of the population  in the occupied  Arab  territories;  and 
3. FURTHER  REQUESTS  the Director-General  to ensure  that  the above-mentioned  funds  be spent  under  the 
direct  supervision  of WHO  and  through  the provision  of its representatives  in the occupied  Arab  territories; 
В 
Bearing  in mind  resolution  WHA26.56,  which  established  the  Special  Committee  of Experts  to study 
the health  conditions  of the inhabitants  of the occupied  territories  in the Middle  East; 
Having  received  the  report  of the Special  Committee  and  noting  from  its content  that  the  Committee 
was refused,  once  again,  to visit  the Arab  territories  under  Israeli  occupation; 
Aware  of resolution  WHA24.33  and  the  relevant  provisions  of the Constitution  of WHO  concerning 
the failure  of Members  to meet  their  obligations  to the Organization, 
1. CONDEMNS  the  refusal  of Israel  to cooperate  with  the  Special  Committee  and  calls  once  again  upon 
its Government  to cooperate  with  it and particularly  to facilitate  its free  movement  in the occupied  territories  ； 
2. EXPRESSES  ITS  APPRECIATION  for the efforts  of the Special  Committee  and  urges  it to continue  its efforts 
in the accomplishment  of its mandate  and  to report  to the Twenty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to continue  to provide  the Special  Committee  with  all facilities  necessary 
for the performance  of its mission  ； 
С 
Noting  General  Assembly  resolution  3236  (XXIX)  concerning  the question  of Palestine  anci  3237  (XXIX) 
concerning  granting  observer  status  to the Palestine  Liberation  Organization  ； 
Bearing  in mind  resolutions  WHA27.36  and  WHA27.37,
