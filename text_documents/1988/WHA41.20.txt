MEMBERS IN ARREARS  IN THE PAYMENT  OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS  TO AN EXTENT 
WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY  INVOKING  ARTICLE  7 OF THE CONSTITUTION 
Replace the draft resolution  proposed  in paragraph  5 of document  A41/8 by the 
following  text: 
The Forty-first  World Health Assembly, 
Having considered  the report of the Committee  of the Executive  Board to Consider 
Certain Financial  Matters  prior to the Forty-first  World Health Assembly  on Members  in 
arrears in the payment  of their contributions  to an extent which would justify  invoking 
Article 7 of the Constitution; 
Having noted that Benin, Chad, Comoros,  Dominican  Republic,  Equatorial  Guinea, 
Grenada,  Guatemala,  Liberia,  Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,  Saint Lucia, and Sierra Leone were 
in arrears  at the time of the opening  of the Health Assembly  to such an extent that it is 
necessary  for the Health Assembly  to consider,  in accordance  with Article  7 of the 
Constitution,  whether  or not the voting privileges  of these Members  should be suspended; 
Having been informed  that as a result of payments  made by Chad and the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya  after the opening  of the Forty-first  World Health Assembly,  these two Member 
States each owe amounts  which are less than the amounts  due from each of them for the 
preceding  two full years； 
Noting that Equatorial  Guinea,  Grenada,  Liberia  and Saint Lucia have either 
communicated  with the Director-General  prior to the opening  of the Forty-first  World 
Health Assembly  indicating  their intention  to settle their arrears  or have made some 
payments  towards  their contributions  prior to that date； 
Noting further  that Benin, Comoros,  Dominican  Republic,  Guatemala  and Sierra Leone 
have neither  communicated  to the Director-General  prior to the opening  of the Forty-first 
World Health Assembly  their intention  to settle their arrears  nor made any payments 
towards their contributions  prior to that date； 
1. EXPRESSES  serious  concern  at the number of Members  in recent years which have been 
in arrears  in the payment  of their contributions  to an extent which would justify 
invoking  Article  7 of the Constitution; 
2. URGES  the Members  concerned  to regularize  their position  at the earliest  possible 
date ； 
3. FURTHER  URGES those Members  which have not communicated  their intention  to settle 
their arrears  to do so as a matter of urgency；

4. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to approach,  through  the Regional  Directors,  the 
Members in arrears  to an extent which would justify  invoking  Article  7 of the 
Constitution,  with a view to pursuing  the question  with the Governments  concerned; 
5. REQUESTS  the Executive  Board, in the light of the Director-General‘s  report and 
having given the Members  concerned  an opportunity  to explain  their situation  to the 
Board, to report to the Forty-second  World Health Assembly  on the situation  with respect 
to the payment  of contributions； 
6. DECIDES  : 
(1) that if, by the time of the opening  of the Forty-second  World Health Assembly, 
Benin, Comoros,  Dominican  Republic,  Guatemala  and Sierra Leone are still in arrears 
in the payment  of their contributions  to an extent which would justify  invoking 
Article 7 of the Constitution,  their voting privileges  shall be suspended  as from 
the said opening,  unless the Executive  Board has previously  found that the Member 
concerned  is faced with exceptional  difficulties  and the Member has made a payment 
considered  by the Board to be reasonable  in the circumstances； 
(2) that any suspension  which takes effect as aforesaid  shall continue  until the 
arrears of the Member State concerned  have been reduced,  at the next and subsequent 
Health Assembly  sessions,  to a level below the amount which would justify  invoking 
Article 7 of the Constitution; 
(3) that this decision  shall be without  prejudice  to the right of any Member State 
to request  restoration  of its voting privileges  in accordance  with Article  7 of the 
Constitution.
