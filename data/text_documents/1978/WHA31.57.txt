WHA31.57  Control  of sexually  transmitted  diseases 
The Thirty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  examined  the Director-General's  report  on the control  of sexually  transmitted  diseases,  submitted 
in accordance  with  resolution  WHA28.58; 
Noting  that  the  prevalence  of sexually  transmitted  diseases  has  reached  high  levels  in many  countries, 
causing  concern  throughout  the  world,  and  that  recent  reports  indicate  a significant  increase  in syphilis  in 
some  countries  and  in gonorrhoea  and  non-gonococcal  urethritis  in many  countries  ； 
Aware  that  such  diseases  are serious  both  for the individual  and  for the community  on account  of the 
complications  to which  they  may  give  rise,  their  frequent  congenital  or perinatal  transmission,  their  contribution  towards  the causation  of infertility,  and  their  socioeconomic  consequences  ； 
Recognizing  that  the  present  situation  is mainly  due  to inadequate  application  in many  countries  of 
known  surveillance  and  control  technology  and  inadequate  appreciation  of educational  and  social  approaches, 
rather  than  to the inadequacy  of the knowledge  available; 
Bearing  in mind  the need  for appropriate  preventive  and  curative  measures; 
1. INVITES  governments  : 
(1) to assess  the scope  and  magnitude  of this  health  and  socioeconomic  problem  in order  to formulate 
and implement,  as part  of the  national  health  programme,  a realistic  and  adequately  funded  control 
programme  for sexually  transmitted  diseases,  including  appropriate  social,  educational  as well  as public 
health  components  ； 
(2) to stress  particularly  the education  of the community  as a whole,  and  especially  adolescents,  on this 
subject,  and  to mobilize  their  active  involvement  in dealing  with  the problem  ； 
(3) to establish  effective  standardized  treatment  schedules  and  to control  the misuse  of antibiotics  with 
a view  to preventing  the development  of bacterial  resistance  to drugs  ； 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to draw  up, disseminate,  and  up-date  as required,  guidelines  on the control  of sexually  transmitted 
diseases,  including  appropriate  recording  and  reporting  mechanisms,  in close  cooperation  with  Member 
States; 
(2) to foster  technical  cooperation  among  Member  States  themselves  for the control  of sexually  transmitted  diseases,  to examine  ways  and  means  of controlling  more  effectively  their  international  spread,  to 
continuously  register  strain  sensitivity,  and  to provide  at appropriate  intervals  information  concerning 
the sensitivity  of strains; 
(3) to stimulate  and  support  activities  and  research  leading  to the development  of more  effective  and 
economical  methods  of prevention,  control,  diagnosis  and  treatment  that  are suitable  for use in primary 
health  care  with  the support  of other  levels  of the health  system  ； 
(4) to cooperate  with  Member  States  in the provision  of basic  and  advanced  training  for the control  of 
sexually  transmitted  diseases; 
(5) to collaborate  with  social  and  educational  intergovernmental  and  nongovernmental  organizations 
in combating  the spread  of these  diseases; 
(6) to continue  his endeavours  to obtain  extrabudgetary  funds  from  sources  within  the United  Nations 
system  and  from  other  international  or private  agencies  in order  to support  the  Organization  and 
governments  in planning,  programming,  conducting  and  evaluating  control  programmes.
