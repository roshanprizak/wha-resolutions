Technical  Assistance  in 1954,  as proposed  in Official  Records  No.  44 and  revised  in document  A6/49,24  is 
technically  sound  and  of value  in the economic  development  of under-developed  countries,  and  conforms 
to the  principles  established  by the  Economic  and  Social  Council  and  the  criteria  established  by the 
Executive  Board  ;

6. AUTHORIZES  the  Director-General  to continue  to take  the  action  necessary  for  the  World  Health 
Organization  to participate  in the Expanded  Programme  of Technical  Assistance.
