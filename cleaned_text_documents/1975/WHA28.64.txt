The Twenty-eighth World Health Assembly, Having considered the Director-General's report, presented inaccordance with resolution EB53.R30, on the promotion of the fluoridation of community water supplies and other approved methods for the prevention of dental caries and on the support of research on the etiology and prevention of dental caries; Agreeing upon the growing worldwide importance of the prevention of dental caries as related to changing nutritional patterns, especially the increased intake of refined carbohydrates; Noting that no nation can expect to solve the problem of dental caries solely by the provision of curative dental services Considering that sufficient information on the safety and effectiveness of the use of fluorides as a method to prevent dental caries has already been obtained; Noting that, while optimization of the fluoride content of water supplies remains the most effective known means of preventing dental caries, other systems of securing some of the benefits of fluoride protection in areas where the fluoride content of drinking-water is insufficient and fluoridation is not feasible have been developed and / or tested since the Twenty-second World Health Assembly; Bearing in mind that the World Health Organization assists Member States in the provision of safe water supplies, and that it is important that in these programmes dental health aspects should be considered and Noting that many Member States are not yet fully exploiting either water fluoridation or other fluoride systems inorganized caries prevention programmes, 1. THANKS the Director-General for his report; 2. RECOMMENDS that the World Health Organization : (1) undertake the programme proposed by the Director-General (2) promote approved methods for the prevention of dental caries, especially by optimization of the fluoride content of water supplies; and (3) assist Member States in the planning and implementation of national caries prevention programmes 3. CALLS UPON Member States to consider as A matter of immediate importance the development of programmes for dental caries prevention within national health programmes; and 4. REQUESTS the Director-General : (1) to endeavour to obtain financial support from budgetary and nonbudgetary sources for this programme; and (2) to report periodically to the World Health Assembly on the progress of the programme, with particular reference to the effects on populations of programmes of dental caries prevention.
