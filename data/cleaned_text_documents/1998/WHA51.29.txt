e Fifty-first World Health Assembly,Having considered the report of the Director-General on WHOs activities on the health effects of climatechange and stratospheric ozone depletion, and its association with the work on the climate agenda;Recalling resolutions WHA46.20 and WHA48.13 on the endorsement of the WHO global strategy forhealth and environment in full compliance with Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development in 1992, and on WHOs efforts to combat emerging and re-emerging infectiousdiseases associated with greater human mobility, global environmental changes and spreading drug resistance;Aware of the growing scientific evidence that the steady increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases causedby human activities may seriously affect the global climate with grave consequences for human health and theenvironment;Aware of the serious threat to the environment and health of the depletion of ozone from the earthsstratosphere due to emissions of chlorofluorocarbons and other gases with ozone-destroying properties, used forrefrigeration and for other industrial purposes, that might increase the incidence of diseases related to ultravioletradiation, such as melanomas, non-melanomous skin cancers, immune defects and nutritional deficiencies;Equally aware that the consequences of these phenomena for human health and well-being should beconsidered within the overall context of other global environmental changes, many of which are related, such asdesertification, deforestation, transboundary air and water pollution and loss of biodiversity;Acknowledging the leading role of WHO, in collaboration with WMO and UNEP, in bringing thepotentially grave threats to human health of these global environmental phenomena to the attention of theinternational community through mechanisms provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change andthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,1. ENDORSES WHOs participation in the climate agenda established by WMO, UNEP, UNESCO andits Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), FAO and the International Council of Scientific Unions(ICSU) to deal more effectively with climate-related issues among appropriate intergovernmental andinternational agencies;WHA51.2922. URGES Member States:(1) to consider the potential threats to human health of climate change and other factors in globalenvironmental change and to take these into account in national planning for sustainable development;(2) wherever appropriate, to consider new approaches to tackle these threats through greater use ofweather and climate forecasts in disease prevention and control;(3) to adopt other strategies, as appropriate, to face up to the human health consequences of climatechange and other factors in global environmental change;(4) to improve prevention of climate change and health effects of stratospheric ozone depletion throughincreased public awareness programmes and action;(5) to encourage applied research and capacity-building in all of these areas;3. REQUESTS the Director-General:(1) to develop further WHOs relations with WMO and other appropriate organizations of the UnitedNations system in order to ensure the continuation of international efforts to foster understanding of thecorrelation of climate and health and the pursuance of ways and means of mitigating public health effectsof global environmental change;(2) to collect and review epidemiological information on risks related to climate and stratospheric ozonedepletion for human health and to make such information accessible to policy-makers and researchinstitutions in Member States;(3) to pursue the assessment of research needs and priorities concerning risks related to climate andstratospheric ozone depletion for human health and the environment, and to promote further research inthis area, in particular in support of improved strategies for response at the national level, in closecooperation with meteorological services;(4) to secure adequate human and financial resources for these activities, in consultation with otheragencies concerned and interested donors.Tenth plenary meeting, 16 May 1998A51 / VR / 10= = =
