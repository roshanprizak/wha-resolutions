WHA7.52  Research 
The Seventh  World  Health  Assembly, 
Considering  the  programme  for  1955  ; 
Recognizing  that  public-health  research  and  co-ordination  of basic  health  research  are  an essential 
function  of the  World  Health  Organization  ; 
Confirming  the policies  on research  established  by the Second  World  Health  Assembly  (resolution 
WHA2.19)  and  by the Executive  Board  at its eighth  session  (resolution  EB8.R34)  ; 
Noting  that  the  Executive  Board,  in its resolution  EB13.R78,  has  requested  the  Director-General, 
in preparing  his proposed  revision  of the programme  of work  for a specific  period  for consideration  by the 
Executive  Board,  to emphasize  in regard  to research  those  aspects  which  are particularly  international  in 
character  ; 
Realizing  the world  shortage  of highly  trained  medical  research  personnel  and the high  cost  of personnel 
and equipment  required  in many  fields  of modern  medical  research  ; 
Recognizing  that  basic  research  is normally  most  satisfactorily  developed  in national  and  local  institutions,  which  may  be assisted  by grants  from  WHO  for  research  contributing  to WHO  programmes  ; 
Recognizing  that,  exceptionally,  WHO  may  be forced  to implement  research  programmes  itself  by 
consequence  of its own  projects, 
1. REQUESTS  the  Executive  Board  and  the  Director-General  to take  note  of previous  resolutions  in 
developing  programme  policies  of the  Organization  ; 
2. URGES  that  Member  States  with  suitable  research  resources  should  co-operate  with  WHO  in research 
programmes  applicable  to the field  of international  health  ; and 
3. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to keep  in close  touch  with  other  specialized  agencies  interested  in 
research  in fields  related  to health,  and  to keep  the Executive  Board  and  the Health  Assembly  informed  of 
any development  in this  connexion  which  may  be of importance  to WHO.
