Agenda  item  27.2  12  May  1997 
Promotion  of chemical  safety，with  special 
attention  to persistent  organic  pollutants 
The Fiftieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on persistent  organic  pollutants; 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA30.47,  WHA31.28  and EB63.R19  on the evaluation  of the effects  of chemicals 
on health,  and resolutions  EB73.R10  and WHA45.32  on the International  Programme  on Chemical  Safety; 
Noting  that the Director-General  established  in May  1996  a steering  committee  on sound  management  of 
chemicals  to coordinate  activities  related  to chemical  safety; 
Noting  that the Memorandum  of Understanding  between  UNEP,  ILO  and WHO  concerning  collaboration 
in the International  Programme  on Chemical  Safety  was renewed  in 1996; 
Noting  that,  in response  to the call of the United  Nations  Conference  on Environment  and Development 
(UNCED)  for improved  international  cooperation  on sound  management  of chemicals,  an Inter-Organization 
Programme  for the Sound  Management  of Chemicals  was  established  in 1995  with  six participating 
organizations  (UNEP,  ILO,  FAO,  WHO,  UNIDO  and OECD),  and that WHO  is the administering  organization; 
Noting  that,  in response  to a recommendation  made  at UNCED  and  to resolution  WHA46.20,  an 
intergovernmental  forum  on chemical  safety  was established  in 1994  with  WHO  as the host  agency, 
1. ENDORSES  the recommendations  of the Intergovernmental  Forum  on Chemical  Safety  to the Health 
Assembly  on persistent  organic  pollutants,  as presented  in the report  of the Director-General; 
2. CALLS  UPON  Member  States: 
(1) to  involve  appropriate  health  officials  in national  efforts  to follow  up and implement  decisions  of 
the UNEP  and WHO  governing  bodies  relating  to the currently  identified  persistent  organic  pollutants; 
(2) to  ensure  that  scientific  assessment  of risks  to health  and  the environment  is the basis  for the 
management  of chemical  risk; 
(3) to  continue  efforts  to establish  or reinforce  national  coordinating  mechanisms  for chemical  safety, 
involving  all responsible  authorities  as well  as the nongovernmental  organizations  concerned; 
(4) to  take  steps  to reduce  reliance  on insecticides  for control  of vector-borne  diseases  through 
promotion  of integrated  pest-management  approaches  in accordance  with  WHO  guidelines,  and through 
support  for the development  and adaptation  of viable  alternative  methods  of disease  vector  control; I 
WHA50.13 
(5) to  establish  or strengthen  governmental  mechanisms  to provide  information  on the levels  and 
sources  of chemical  contaminants  in all media,  and in particular  in food,  as well  as on the levels  of 
exposure  of the population; 
(6) to  ensure  that  the use of DDT  is authorized  by governments  for public  health  purposes  only,  and 
that, in those  instances,  such  use is limited  to government-authorized  programmes  that take  an integrated 
approach  and  that  strong  steps  are taken  to ensure  that  there  is no diversion  of DDT  to entities  in the 
private  sector; 
(7) to  revitalize  measures  for training  and  for increasing  public  awareness  in collaboration  with 
intergovernmental  and nongovernmental  organizations,  in order  to prevent  poisonings  by chemicals  and, 
in particular,  pesticides; 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to  participate  actively  in the intergovernmental  negotiating  committees  on the currently  identified 
persistent  organic  pollutants,  in the drafting  of a legally  binding  instrument  for the "prior  informed 
consent"  procedure,  and in other  intergovernmental  meetings  on issues  requiring  health  expertise,  in 
particular  those  relating  to the use of pesticides  for vector  control,  in order  to ensure  that international 
commitments  on hazardous  chemicals  are realistic  and effective  and that they  protect  human  health  and 
the environment; 
(2) to  support  research  on integrated  approaches  to the control  of vector-borne  diseases,  including 
environmental  management,  including  engagement  of appropriate  WHO  collaborating  centres  in this 
effort; 
(3) to  continue  to support  the acceleration  and expansion  of WHO's  activities  for the assessment  of 
chemicals  risk as a basis  for national  decision-making  on its management,  including  the joint  FAO/WHO 
programmes  on food  additives  and contaminants  and veterinary  drug  residues  and on pesticide  residues; 
(4) to  cooperate  with  Member  States  in facilitating  the exchange  of information  on chemicals  utilizing 
modern  technology,  especially  in the collation  and provision  of reliable  and comparable  data,  in particular 
from  developing  countries,  on human  exposure,  incidents  of poisonings  and other  adverse  health  effects; 
(5) to  take  the necessary  steps  to reinforce  WHO's  leadership  in undertaking  risk assessment  as a basis 
for tackling  high-priority  problems  as they  emerge,  and in promoting  and coordinating  related  research, 
for example,  on potential  endocrine-related  health  effects  of exposure  to chemicals  and on the possible 
causal  links  with  cancer  and reproductive,  neurological  and immunological  disorders; 
(6) to  continue  efforts  to enhance  technical  cooperation  with  Member  States  for the determination  of 
their  capacity-building  needs,  and  for the implementation  of programmes  for the management  of 
chemicals  risk,  in collaboration  with  participants  in the Inter-Organization  Programme  for the Sound 
Management  of Chemicals  and with  other  organizations; 
(7) to  report  on the outcome  of the deliberations  at the Health  Assembly  to the UNEP  Governing 
Council; 
(8) to  report  to a future  Health  Assembly  on progress  in implementing  this resolution.
