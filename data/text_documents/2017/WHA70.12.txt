Agenda item 15.6 31 May 20 17 
Cancer preventio n and control in the context of  
an integrated approach  
 
The Seventieth  World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on cancer prevention and control in the context of an integrated 
approach;1 
Acknowledging that, in 2012, cancer was the second leading cause of death in the world with 
8.2 million cancer -related deaths, the majority of which oc curred in low - and middle -income 
countries;  
Recognizing that cancer is a leading cause of morbidity globally and a growing public health 
concern, with the annual number of new cancer cases projected to increase from 14.1  million in 2012 
to 21.6  million by 2030;  
Aware that certain population groups experience inequalities in risk factor exposure and in 
access to screening, early diagnosis and timely and appropriate treatment, and that they also 
experience poorer outcomes for cancer; and recognizing that diff erent cancer control strategies are 
required for specific groups of cancer patients, such as children and adolescents;  
Noting that risk reduction has the potential to prevent around half of all cancers;  
Aware that early diagnosis and prompt and appropriate  treatment, including pain relief and 
palliative care, can reduce mortality and improve the outcomes and quality of life of cancer patients;  
Recognizing with appreciation the introduction of new pharmaceutical products based on 
investment in innovation fo r cancer treatment in recent years, and noting with great concern the 
increasing cost to health systems and patients;  
Emphasizing the importance of addressing barriers in access to safe, quality, effective and 
affordable medicines, medical products and ap propriate technology for cancer prevention, detection, 
screening diagnosis and treatment, including surgery, by strengthening national health systems and 
international cooperation, including human resources, with the ultimate aim of enhancing access for 
patients, including through increasing the capacity of the health systems to provide such access;  
Recalling resolution WHA58.22 (2005) on cancer prevention and control;  
                                                      
1 Document A70/32.  WHA 70.12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 Recalling also United Nations General Assembly resolution 66/2 (2011) on the Political 
Declaration of the High -level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of 
Non-communicable Diseases, which includes a road map of national commitments from Heads of 
State and Government to address cancer and other noncommunicable disease s; 
Recalling further resolution WHA66.10 (2013) endorsing the global action plan for the 
prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013 –2020, which provides guidance on how 
Member States can realize the commitments they made in the Political Declaration of the High -level 
Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non -communicable Diseases, 
including those related to addressing cancer;  
Recalling in addition United Nations General Assembly resolution 68/300 (2014) on the 
Outcome document of the high -level meeting of the General Assembly on the comprehensive review 
and assessment of the progress achieved in th e prevention and control of non -communicable diseases, 
which sets out the continued and increased commitments that are  essential in order to realize the road 
map of commitments to address cancer and other noncommunicable diseases included in the Political 
Declaration of the High -level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of 
Non-communicable Diseas es, including four time -bound national commitments for 2015 and 2016;  
Mindful of the existing monitoring tool that WHO is using to tr ack the extent to which its 
194 Member States are implementing these four time -bound commitments to address cancer and othe r 
noncommunicable diseases, in accordance with the technical note1 published by WHO on 1 May 2015 
pursuant to decision EB136(13) (2015);  
Mindful also of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control;  
Also mindful of the Sustainable Development Goals of t he 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, specifically Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well -being for all at all ages) with 
its target 3.4 to reduce, by 2030, premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases by one third, 
and target 3.8 on achi eving universal health coverage;  
Appreciating the efforts made by Member States2 and international partners in recent years to 
prevent and control cancer, but mindful of the need for further action;  
Reaffirming the global strategy and plan of action on pub lic health, innovation and intellectual 
property;  
Reaffirming also the rights of Member States to the full use of the flexibilities in the 
WTO  Agreement on Trade -related Aspects of the Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to increase 
access to affordable, safe, effective and quality medicines, noting that, inter alia, intellectual property 
rights are an important incentive in the development of new health products,
