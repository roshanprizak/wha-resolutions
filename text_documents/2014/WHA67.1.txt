Agenda item 12.1 21 May 20 14 
Global strategy and targets for tuberculosis 
prevention, care and control after 2015  
 
The Sixty-seventh  World  Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on the draft global strategy and targets for tuberculosis prevention, 
care and control after 2015;1 
Acknowledging the progress made towards the achievement of Millennium Development 
Goal  6 (Combat HIV/AIDS, ma laria and other diseases) for 2015 following the United Nations 
Millennium Declaration and related 2015 tuberculosis targets, through the adoption of the DOTS 
strategy, the Stop TB Strategy and the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006 –2015, as well as the financing  of 
national plans based on those frameworks, as called for, inter alia, in resolution WHA60.19 on 
tuberculosis control;  
Concerned by the persisting gaps and the uneven progress made towards current targets, and in 
addition that some regions, Member States , communities and vulnerable groups require specific 
strategies and support to accelerate progress in preventing disease and deaths, and to expand access to 
needed interventions and new tools;  
Further concerned that even with significant progress, an estim ated three million people who 
contract tuberculosis each year will not have their disease detected or will not receive appropriate care 
and treatment;  
Cognizant of the serious economic and social consequences of tuberculosis and of the burden 
borne by many  of those affected when seeking care and adhering to tuberculosis treatment;  
Considering resolution WHA62.15 on prevention and control of multidrug -resistant tuberculosis 
and extensively drug -resistant tuberculosis, and its appeal for action; aware that th e response to the 
crisis to date has been insufficient despite the introduction of new rapid diagnostic tests and efforts to 
scale up disease management; aware also that the vast majority of those in need still lack access to 
high-quality prevention, treat ment and care services; and alarmed at the grave individual and public 
health risks posed by multidrug -resistant tuberculosis;  
Aware that HIV coinfection is the main reason for the failure to meet tuberculosis control 
targets in high -HIV prevalence setting s and that tuberculosis is a major cause of deaths among people 
living with HIV, and recognizing the need for substantially enhanced joint action in addressing the 
dual epidemics of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS through increasing integration of primary care s ervices 
in order to improve access to care;

2 Recognizing that further progress on tuberculosis and other health priorities identified in the 
United Nations Millennium Declaration must be made in the decades beyond 2015, and that progress 
on all of those pri orities requires overall commitment to health system strengthening and progress 
towards universal health coverage;  
Acknowledging that progress against tuberculosis depends on action within and beyond the 
health sector in order to address the social and eco nomic determinants of disease, including expansion 
of social protection and overall poverty reduction;  
Guided by resolution WHA61.17 on the health of migrants and its appeal for action, and 
recognizing the need for increased collaboration between high - and low-incidence countries and 
regions in strengthening tuberculosis monitoring and control mechanisms, including with regard to the 
growing mobility of labour;  
Noting the need for increased investment in accelerated implementation of innovations at 
country level as well as in the research and development of new tools for tuberculosis care and 
prevention that are essential for the elimination of tuberculosis,  
1. ADOPTS the global strategy and targets for tuberculosis prevention, care and control after 2015 
with: 
(1) its bold vision of a world without tuberculosis, and its targets of ending the global 
tuberculosis epidemic by 2035 through a reduction in tuberculosis deaths by 95% and in 
tuberculosis incidence by 90% (or to fewer than 10 tuberculosis cases per 1 00 000 population), 
and elimination of associated catastrophic costs for tuberculosis -affected households;  
(2) its associated milestones for 2020, 2025 and 2030;  
(3) its principles addressing: government stewardship and accountability; coalition -building 
with affected communities and civil society; equity, human rights and ethics; and adaptation to 
fit the needs of each epidemiological, socioeconomic and health system context;  
(4) its three pillars of: integrated, patient -centred care and prevention;  bold p olicies and 
supportive systems; and intensified research and innovation;  
2. URGES all Member States:1 
(1) to adapt the strategy in line with national priorities and specificities;  
(2) to implement, monitor and evaluate the strategy’s proposed tuberculosis -specific health 
sector and multisectoral actions with high -level commitment and adequate financing, taking into 
account the local settings;  
(3) to seek, with the full engagement of a wide range of stakeholders, to prevent the 
persistence of high incidence rates of tuberculosis within specific communities or geographical 
settings;

  3 3. INVITES international, regional, national and local partners from within and beyond the health 
sector to engage in, and support, the implementation of the strategy;  
4. REQUESTS the Director -General:  
(1) to provide guidance to Member States on how to adapt and operationalize the strategy, 
including the promotion of cross -border collaboration to address the needs of vulnerable 
communities, including migrant populations, and the thr eats posed by drug resistance;  
(2) to coordinate and contribute to the implementation of the post -2015 global tuberculosis 
strategy, working with Member States, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria, UNITAID and other global and regional financing institutions, as well as all 
constituencies of the Stop TB Partnership and the additional multisectoral partners required to 
achieve the goal and objectives of the strategy;  
(3) to further develop and update global normative and policy guidance o n tuberculosis 
prevention, care and control, as new evidence is gathered and innovations are developed, adding 
to the tools and strategic approaches that are available for ending the global epidemic and 
moving far more rapidly towards tuberculosis eliminat ion; 
(4) to support Member States upon request in the adaptation and implementation of the 
strategy, as well as in the development of nationally appropriate indicators, milestones and 
targets to contribute to local and global achievement of the 2035 target ; 
(5) to monitor the implementation of the strategy, and evaluate impact in terms of progress 
towards set milestones and targets;  
(6) to promote the research and knowledge generation required to end the global tuberculosis 
epidemic and eliminate tuberculos is, including accelerated discovery and development of new 
or improved diagnostics, treatment and preventive tools, in particular efficient vaccines, and the 
stimulation of the uptake of resulting innovations;  
(7) to promote equitable access to new tools a nd medical products for the prevention, 
diagnosis, and treatment of tuberculosis and multidrug -resistant tuberculosis as they become 
available;  
(8) to work with the Stop TB Partnership, including active support of the development of the 
global investment p lan, and, where appropriate, seeking out new partners who can leverage 
effective commitment and innovation within and beyond the health sector in order to implement 
the strategy effectively;  
(9) to report on the progress achieved to the Seventieth and Seve nty-third World Health 
Assemblies, and at regular intervals thereafter, through the Executive Board.
