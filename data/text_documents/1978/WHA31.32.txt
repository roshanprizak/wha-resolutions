WHA31.32  Action  programme  on essential  drugs 
The Thirty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolutions  WHA28.66  and  EB61.R17; 
Having  considered  the progress  report  of the Director-General  on drug  policies  and  management; 
Realizing  that  large  segments  of the world's  population  do not  have  access  to the most  essential  drugs 
and vaccines  that  are indispensable  to ensure  effective  health  care; 
Recognizing  the importance  of an adequate  supply  of essential  drugs  and  vaccines  to meet  the real  health 
needs  of the people,  through  the implementation  of national  programmes  of health  care; 
Deeply  concerned  by the high  proportion  of health  budgets  spent  on pharmaceuticals  by governments, 
particularly  of developing  countries,  thereby  limiting  the  remaining  funds  available  for  the  provision  of 
adequate  health  care  to the whole  population; 
Stressing  the need  to provide  essential  drugs  of adequate  quality,  in sufficient  quantity  and  at reasonable cost  to meet  the health  needs  of these  countries; 
Considering  that  local  production  of essential  drugs  and  vaccines  is a legitimate  aspiration  which 
developing  countries  have  expressed  on many  occasions,  and  that  considerable  progress  has  been  achieved  in 
some  countries; 
Considering  that  the  establishment  of a pharmaceutical  industry  in countries  where  it does  not  exist 
requires  transfer  of appropriate  technology  and  investment,  and  that  most  developing  countries  cannot 
afford  this  without  international  cooperation  ； 
Recognizing  the importance  of objective  information  about  pharmaceuticals  and  the risk  of uncontrolled 
promotional  activity  by manufacturers,  particularly  in developing  countries  ； 
Convinced  that  collective  purchases  of large  quantities  of pharmaceuticals  would  substantially  reduce 
their  costs  ； 
Convinced  that  urgent  international  action  is required  to alleviate  this  situation  through  the establishment 
of an action  programme  of technical  cooperation  on essential  drugs  aimed  at strengthening  the  national 
capabilities  of developing  countries  in the field  of selection  and  proper  use of essential  drugs  to meet  their  real 
needs,  and  in local  production  and  quality  control,  wherever  feasible,  of such  drugs  ； 
Highly  appreciating  the steps  already  taken  by the Director-General  to make  available  essential  drugs 
and vaccines  necessary  for the extension  of the health  care  coverage  of the population; 
1. ENDORSES  resolution  EB61.R17; 
2. URGES  Member  States,  particularly  developing  countries,  to : 
(1) establish  adequate  drug  procurement,  storage  and  distribution  systems  in order  to make  available 
drugs  of adequate  quality,  at reasonable  prices,  to the population; 
(2) establish  national  drug  lists  or formularies  by international  nonproprietary  (generic)  names,  including 
essential  drugs  selected  on the basis  of the health  needs  of countries  and  taking  into  account  the criteria 
of the WHO  Expert  Committee  on the Selection  of Essential  Drugs  {Technical  Report  Series  No.  615); 
(3) enact  legislation  as appropriate  covering  drug  registration,  use  or prescription  by generic  names, 
control  of drug  information,  including  therapeutic  indications  and  mention  of side-effects,  price  regulation 
and definition  of the types  of drugs  authorized  for use or prescription  by different  levels  of health  workers; 
(4) collaborate  in the exchange  of information  on drug  policies  and  management  through  bilateral  or 
multilateral  programmes  and  WHO  ； 
3. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to continue  to identify  the drugs  and  vaccines  which,  in the light  of scientific  knowledge,  are indispensable  for primary  health  care  and  control  of diseases  prevalent  in the population,  and  to update 
periodically  this  aspect  of the report  of the WHO  Expert  Committee  on the Selection  of Essential  Drugs; 
(2) to cooperate  with  Member  States  in formulating  drug  policies  and  management  programmes  that 
are relevant  to the health  needs  of populations  and  are aimed  at ensuring  access  of the whole  population 
to essential  drugs  at a cost  the country  can afford; 
(3) to improve  existing  WHO  supply  services  for drugs,  including  vaccines,  and  medical  equipment, 
through  closer  collaboration  with  the United  Nations  Children's  Fund,  and  to ensure  that  developing 
countries  take  full  advantage  of such  services  ； 
(4) to ensure  collaboration  with  the United  Nations  Development  Programme,  the  World  Bank  and 
regional  development  banks  and  funds,  the United  Nations  Children's  Fund  and  the United  Nations 
Industrial  Development  Organization  with  a view  to ensuring  that  technical  expertise  and  financing  are 
made  available  to interested  countries  for establishing,  wherever  feasible,  local  production  corresponding 
to their  health  needs,  it being  understood  that  financing  should  be independent  of the source  of technology; 
(5) to develop  further  the dialogue  with  pharmaceutical  industries  in order  to assure  their  collaboration 
in meeting  the health  needs  of large  underserved  segments  of the world's  population; 
(6) to study  how  prices  of pharmaceutical  products  are determined  and  possible  strategies  for reducing 
such  prices,  including  the development  of a code  of marketing  practices,  with  special  emphasis  on pharmaceutical  products  essential  for the populations  of developing  countries  ； 
(7) to take  appropriate  steps  to cooperate  with  Member  States  in developing  quality  control  systems  for 
drugs,  whether  imported  or locally  produced,  and  to establish  regional  quality  control  networks  ； 
(8) to foster  exchange  of information  among  Member  States  on drug  policies  and  management  and  on 
technical  aspects  of pharmaceutical  products  ； 
(9) to submit  to the sixty-third  session  of the Executive  Board  a comprehensive  action  programme  as 
outlined  above,  aimed  at fostering  technical  cooperation  among  developing  countries,  and  to stimulate 
bilateral  and  multilateral  cooperation  in this  programme  ； 
(10) to invite  the participation  of governments  directly  interested  in implementing  this  action  programme 
in their  own  countries,  governments  willing  to provide  support,  relevant  United  Nations  agencies,  and 
other  appropriate  cooperating  parties  ； 
(11) to submit  a report  on the progress  achieved  in the implementation  of this  action  programme  to 
subsequent  sessions  of the Executive  Board  and  Health  Assembly.
