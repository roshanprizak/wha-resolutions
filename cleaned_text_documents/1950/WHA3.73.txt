I. The Third World Health Assembly, Having considered a report on the status of contributions to the budget for 1948 NOTES that certain Members have failed to pay in full their assessed contributions to the budget for that year. II. Furthermore, the Third World Health Assembly, While noting the resolution by the Second World Health Assembly108 and the recommendations of the Executive Board109 in pursuance of that resolution, that action be taken as provided in Article 7 of the Constitution, also considers that Whereas certain of these Members have paid all but a small proportion of their contribution, Whereas other Members have indicated that they have put in motion their legislative machinery to pay their contributions, and Whereas other Members have only recently joined the Organization and therefore have not been able to arrange for payment through their legislative bodies ; 1. RESOLVES that additional time shall be given to these Members to acquit themselves of their financial obligations to the Organization, and calls upon them to do so promptly ; 2. REQUESTS the Executive Board to furnish a full report to the Fourth World Health Assembly on any Members whose assessments to the 1948 budget have not been paid at the time of convening of the Assembly, together with recommendations for any action that the Board may consider necessary and appropriate. (First report of the Committee on Administration, Finance and Legal Matters, adopted at fifth plenary meeting, 16 May 1950) [A3 / R / 14]
