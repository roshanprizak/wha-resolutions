with the social,  cultural  and economic  context  of the country； 
Emphasizing  that financing  of the health sector should be considered  as an 
investment  in the future productive  potential  of countries,  and that national  and

populations；

efficient  and equitable  deployment  of available  resources  within the context  of 
national  development  priorities； 
(2) to develop their capabilities  to analyse the linkages  between  the various 
sectors related  to health,  and their influence  on the health sector,  so as to be 
able to recommend  appropriate  strategies  in the face of rapid changes； 
(3) to strengthen  their capabilities  to analyse,  plan and implement  structural 
adjustments  in the health sector,  where necessary,  bearing  in mind the availability 
of internal  and external  resources  and taking into account  national  priorities；

capabilities  mentioned  above；

programmes  on the health sector at country  level, with a view to assisting  these 
countries  to overcome  any adverse  consequences  of external  economic  conditions  and
