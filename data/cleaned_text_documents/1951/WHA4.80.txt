Believing that the International Sanitary Regulations (WHO Regulations No. 2) represent only part of the action required to remove the international threat of quarantinable diseases ; Believing that parallel action is equally necessary to remove insanitary conditions conducive to the existence of such diseases, especially in and around ports and airports ; Believing that health administrations by improving sanitary conditions and expanding their health and medical services, especially in and around ports and airports, are thereby securing their own protection against the entry and establishment of quarantinable diseases ; Believing that territories with satisfactory sanitary conditions and efficient health and medical services may reduce quarantine measures against international traffic ; Believing that the freest possible movement of international traffic is highly desirable in the interests of world economic and social, including health, progress, The Fourth World Health Assembly 1. RECOMMENDS to all governments that they improve sanitary and environmental conditiions, especially in and around ports and airports and, in particular, that they : (1) eliminate and prevent the breeding of rodents, mosquito vectors of human diseases and ectoparasites ; (2) eliminate infection of cholera by providing, inter alia, pure water and food supplies and service, for the proper disposal of human wastes ; (3) raise the level of protection, by vaccination where appropriate orby other means, against plagues cholera, yellow fever, smallpox and typhus ; (4) relax when necessary, and health circumstances are satisfactory, the application to their territories of appropriate articles of WHO Regulations No. 2 ; 2. REQUESTS the regional committees of the Organization to take early and continuous action to persuade Member States in their regions to adopt the recommendations in paragraph 1 above ; 3. REQUESTS the Executive Board, in its preparation of programmes and otherwise, to give effect to the recommendations in paragraph 1 above.
