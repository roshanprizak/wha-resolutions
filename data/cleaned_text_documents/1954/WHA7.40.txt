The Seventh World Health Assembly, Having considered resolution EB13.R39 of the Executive Board, on the financial problems which face the World Health Organization in implementing the programme planned for 1954 ; Noting the actions taken by the Director-General to alleviate the financial problems in 1954 by applying, inter alia, to the greatest extent possible, measures inaccordance with the policy established by the Executive Board in resolution EB11.R57 and approved by the Sixth World Health Assembly in resolution WHA6.9 ; Noting the reaffirmation by the Executive Board in resolution EB13.R39 of the policy laid down in resolution EB11.R57.4 as applicable to the 1954 situation ; Noting that, as a result of the review of the programme undertaken early in 1954, it became necessary to request a loan from Technical Assistance funds in an amount of $185 000 against future earmarkings and allocations to the Organization in 1954, which loan has been granted ; Noting that, as a result of an increase in the 1954 earmarking to WHO from Technical Assistance funds at the 28th meeting of the Technical Assistance Board, the Director-General found it possible to implement from Technical Assistance funds approved projects which had earlier been transferred for financing under the regular budget in an amount equivalent to the advance of $250 000 made by him from the Working Capital Fund, thus rendering unnecessary the consideration of a supplementary budget to reimburse the Working Capital Fund ; Having considered a report by the Director-General pursuant to resolution EB13.R39, on the modifications effected in the planned overall programme for 1954, 1. APPROVES the arrangements made by the Executive Board and the Director-General in so arranging for the use of all resources available to WHO in 1954 as to produce as little disruption of the planned programme as possible ; and 2. APPROVES the modifications effected in the planned programme for 1954 as reported by the DirectorGeneral. Handb. Res., 2nd ed., 3.2 Adopted at the tenth plenary meeting, 20 May 1954 (section 5 of the fourth report of the Committee on Programme and Budget)
