of Afghanistan, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina,  Armenia, Central African Republic, Comoros, 
Dominican Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Kyrgyzstan, Libe ria, Nauru, Niger, Somalia and Turkmenistan 
remained suspended, such suspension to continue until the arrears of the Member State concerned have been reduced, at the present or future Health Assemblies, to a level below the amount which 
would justify invoking Article 7 of the Constitution; 
Noting that Democratic Republic of Congo and Dominica were in arrears at the time of the 
opening of the Fifty-ninth World Health Assembly to such an extent that it was necessary for the

Assembly, 
DECIDES:

would justify invoking Article 7 of the Constitution, their voting privileges shall be suspended 
as from the said opening; 
(2) that any suspension that takes effect as aforesaid shall continue at the Sixtieth and 
subsequent Health Assemblies, until the arrears of Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Dominica have been reduced to a level below the amount which would justify invoking  
Article 7 of the Constitution; 
(3) that this decision shall be without prejudice to the right of any Member to request 
restoration of its voting privileges in accordance with Article 7 of the Constitution.
