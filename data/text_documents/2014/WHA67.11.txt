Public health impacts of exposure  to mercury and 
mercury compounds: the role of WHO and 
ministries of public  health in the implementation  
of the Minamata Convention  
 
The Sixty -seventh World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on public health impacts of exposure to mercury and mercury 
compounds: the role of WHO and ministries of public health in the im plementation of the 
Minamata  Convention;1 
Recalling World Health Assembly resolutions WHA60.17 on oral health: action plan for 
promotion and integrated disease prevention, WHA63.25 on the improvement of health through safe 
and environmentally sound waste m anagement, and WHA59.15 on the Strategic Approach to 
International Chemicals Management , as well as the strategy for strengthening the engagement of the 
health sector in the implementation of the strategic approach adopted by the International Conference 
on Chemicals Management at its third session;  
Recognizing the importance of dealing effectively with the health aspects of the challenges that 
chemicals and wastes, including mercury, may pose,  particularly to vulnerable populations, especially 
women, child ren, and, through them, future generations;  
Recalling the renewed commitments on sustainable development set out in the United  Nations 
Conference on Sustainable Development Rio+20 outcome document “The future we want”, of 
June 2012, as well as  the Adelaide  Statement on Health in All Policies of 2010, and the 8th Global 
Conference on Health Promotion, held in Helsinki in 2013, which promoted intersectoral collaboration 
across all sectors to achieve healthy populations;  
Taking note that negotiations on the te xt of a new multilateral environmental agreement on 
mercury were concluded in October 2013  with the adoption of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, 
being the first time that a multilateral environmental agreement includes a specific article on health, as 
well as other relevant provisions, and that the Convention places certain obligations on Parties that 
will require action , as applicable, by the health sector, together with other competent sectors, including 
the progressive phase -out, resulting from bannin g the manufacture, import or export by 2020 of 
mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers, of mercury -conta ining cosmetics, including 
skin-lightening soaps and creams, and mercury -containing topical antiseptics, measures to be taken to

2 phase down mercury -added dental amalgam, and the development of public health strategies on the 
exposure to mercury of artisanal and small -scale gold miners and their communities;  
Recalling that the objective of the Minamata Convention on Mercury is to protect human health 
and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds;  
Bearing in mind that the Minamata Convention on Mercury encourages Parties to: (a)  promote 
the development and implementation of strategies and programmes to iden tify and protect populations 
at risk, particularly vulnerable populations, and which may include adopting science -based health 
guidelines relating to the exposure to mercury and mercury compounds, setting targets for mercury 
exposure reduction, where appro priate, and public education, with the participation of public health 
and other involved sectors; (b) promote the development and implementation of science -based 
educational and preventive programmes on occupational exposure to mercury and mercury 
compound s; (c) promote appropriate health care services for prevention, treatment and care for 
populations affected by the exposure to mercury or mercury compounds; and (d) establish and 
strengthen, as appropriate, the institutional and health professional capacit ies for the prevention, 
diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of health risks related to the exposure to mercury and mercury 
compounds;  
Noting that the Minamata Convention on Mercury states that the Conference of the Parties, in 
considering health -related ac tivities, should consult, collaborate and promote cooperation and 
exchange of information with WHO, ILO and other relevant intergovernmental organizations, as 
appropriate;  
Thanking the Secretariat for its preparatory work, during the negotiations, analysin g different 
risks and available substitutes, as well as analysing and identifying areas requiring additional or new 
effort, under the Minamata Convention, and encouraging further and continuous analysis and other 
efforts as may be needed,
