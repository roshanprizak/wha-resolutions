Complete  Disarmament 
The Twentieth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  resolution  2162  (XXI)  of the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  which  notes  in 
particular  that  weapons  of mass  destruction  constitute  a danger  to all mankind  and  that  strict  observance 
of the  rules  of international  law  on the  conduct  of warfare  is in the  interest  of maintaining  the  accepted 
norms  of civilization;  and  which  calls  upon  all States  to accede  to the  Protocol  for  the  Prohibition  of the 
Use in War  of Asphyxiating,  Poisonous  or Other  Gases,  and  of Bacteriological  Methods  of Warfare,  signed 
at Geneva  on 17 June  1925,  and  to observe  strictly  the  principles  and  aims  of the  Protocol; 
Guided  by the aims  and  principles  of the Constitution  of the World  Health  Organization,  and  proceeding 
from  the  humane  nature  of both  the  Organization  and  the  medical  profession  in general; 
Referring  to resolutions  WHA11.31  and  WHAI5.51,  in which  the  World  Health  Assembly  already 
expressed  its thorough  interest  in the  consolidation  of peace  as an inalienable  prerequisite  for  preservation 
and improvement  of the  health  of all nations;  and 
Deeply  convinced  that  scientific  achievements,  and  particularly  in the  field  of biology  and  medicine 
—that  most  humane  science—should  be used  only  for  mankind's  benefit,  but  never  to do it any  harm, 
1. WELCOMES  resolution  2162  (XXI)  of the  United  Nations  General  Assembly;  and 
2. CALLS  UPON  all Member  States  to exert  every  effort  to implement  the  above-mentioned  resolution.
