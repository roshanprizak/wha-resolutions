children in appropriate dosage forms , and proble ms with rational use of children’s medicines in many 
countries, and that, globally, children aged under five years still do not have secure access to 
medicines that treat pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, HIV infection, AIDS and malaria, as 
well as medicines for many other infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases and rare diseases;

most suitable for children , as well as on new medicines for diseases th at affect children, that are 
appropriate for use in all environments, including areas lacking access to clean water;  
Aware that an important factor linked to morbidity and mortality of children is the lack of safe, 
effective, affordable and quality -assured  medicines for children, and in some circumstances, lack of 
packaging in child -proof containers;  
Noting that despite sustained efforts over a number of decades by Member States, the WHO 
Secretariat and partners, many countries are still facing multiple cha llenges in ensuring the 
availability, affordability, quality assurance and rational use of children’s medicines;

and promote well -being for all at all ages”, and par ticularly noting the targets related to access to
