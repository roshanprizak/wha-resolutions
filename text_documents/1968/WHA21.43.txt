WHA21.43  Health  Aspects  of Population  Dynamics 
The Twenty-first  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the  Director-General  on health  aspects  of population  dynamics; 
Noting  with  satisfaction  the  development  of activities  in reference  services,  research,  and  training,  and 
the provision  of advisory  services  to Member  States,  on request,  on the health  aspects  of human  reproduction, 
of family  planning,  and  of population  dynamics  within  the  context  of resolutions  WHA  18.49,  WHAI9.43, 
and WHA20.41  ; 
Emphasizing  the  concept  that  this  programme  requires  the  consideration  of economic,  social,  cultural, 
psychological  and  health  factors  in their  proper  perspective; 
Reaffirming  the considerations  expressed  in these  resolutions; 
Recognizing  that  family  planning  is viewed  by many  Member  States  as an important  component  of basic 
health  services,  particularly  of maternal  and  child  health,  and  in the  promotion  of family  health,  and  plays 
a role  in social  and  economic  development; 
Reiterating  the  opinion  that  every  family  should  have  the  opportunity  of obtaining  information  and 
advice  on problems  connected  with  family  planning,  including  fertility  and  sterility;  and 
Agreeing  that  our  understanding  of numerous  problems  related  to the health  aspects  of human  reproduction,  family  planning  and  population  is still  limited, 
1. CONGRATULATES  the  Director-General  on the  work  accomplished  during  the year  1967; 
2. APPROVES  the  report  of the  Director-General;  and 
3. REQUESTS  the  Director-General 
(a) to  continue  to develop  the programme  in this  field  in accordance  with  the  principles  laid  down  in 
resolutions  WHA18.49,  WHA19.43  and  WHA20.41  including  also  the  encouragement  of research  on 
psychological  factors  related  to the  health  aspects  of human  reproduction; 
(b) to  continue  to assist  Member  States  upon  their  request  in the  development  of their  programmes 
with special  reference  to: 
(i) the  integration  of family  planning  within  basic  health  services  without  prejudice  to the preventive 
and curative  activities  which  normally  are  the  responsibility  of those  services; 
(ii) appropriate  training  programmes  for  health  professionals  at all levels; 
(c) to  analyse  further  the  health  manpower  requirements  for  such  services  and  the  supervision  and 
training  needs  of such  manpower  in actual  field  situations  under  specific  local  conditions;  and 
(d) to  report  on the  progress  of the programme  to the Twenty-second  World  Health  Assembly.
