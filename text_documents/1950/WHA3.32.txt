WHA3.32  Physical  Training 
The Third  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  studied  the information  presented  by the Director-General  ; 
Considering  that  the  field  of physical  training  presents  many  non-medical  aspects  and  does  not constitute  a priority  subject  as laid  down  by the First  World  Health  Assembly,  and  further, 
Having  in mind  the present  budgetary  limitations  of the World  Health  Organization, 
REQUESTS  the Director-General 
(1) to postpone  further  action  in the establishment  of a programme  in the field  of physical  training  ; 
(2) to continue  participation  in this activity  as far as is feasible  within  the budget  of the Organization  ; 
(3) to maintain  the collaboration  established  in this connexion  with  the United  Nations  Department  of Social  Affairs,  the specialized  agencies,  and  relevant  non-governmental  organizations,  and 
(4) to report  to the Executive  Board  and the Fourth  World  Health  Assembly  if a programme  on physical health  becomes  feasible. (Fourth  report  of the Committee  on Programme,  adopted at seventh  plenary  meeting,  25 May  1950)  [A3/R/73]
