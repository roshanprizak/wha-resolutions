The Nineteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Noting  the recommendations  of the Executive  Board  with  regard  to remuneration  of staff  in the ungraded 
posts,  based,  in the  case  of Assistant  Directors-General  and  Regional  Directors,  on  recommendations 
originating  from  the  International  Civil  Service  Advisory  Board, 
1. CONCURS  with  the  view  of the  Board  that  the  proposed  adjustments  are  reasonable  in the  light  of 
movements  in salary  levels  and  income  tax  schedules  outside  the  international  organizations  and  are 
necessary  to the  maintenance  of a single  integrated  salary  and  allowance  system  in the  Organization;  and, 
consequently, 
2. ESTABLISHLS  the  salary  for  the  post  of Deputy  Director-General  at $34  000,  before  staff  assessment, 
with  concurrent  application  of the  revised  staff  assessment  rales  adopted  by  the  Executive  Board  at its 
thirty-seventh  session,  resulting  in a revised  net  salary  for  the  post  of Deputy  Director-General  of $23  300 
per annum; 
3. ESTABLISHES  the  salary  for  Assistant  Directors-General  and  Regional  Directors  at $30  000,  before  staff 
assessment,  with  concurrent  application  of the revised  staff  assessment  rates  adopted  by the Executive  Board 
at its thirty-seventh  session,  resulting  in a revised  net  salary  for such  posts  of $21  000;  and 
4. DECIDES  that  these  salary  levels  shall  be effective  from  1 January  1966  in view  of and  in relation  to the 
revision  of staff  assessment  rates  and  all post  adjustment  classifications  on that  date,  as recommended  by 
the International  Civil  Service  Advisory  Board.
