POLICY ON PATENTS 
The Thirty-fifth  World Health Assembly, 
Recognizing  the need for affirmative  action to make health care resources  available  to 
all, and the role of incentives  in the development  of health technology  that is not at present 
available； 
Convinced  that, in contributing  to the development  of health technology,  WHO should seek 
to ensure its wide availability  to Member States at appropriate  cost； 
Recognizing  that, when desirable,  close contacts  with respect  to policy on patents  should 
be maintained  between  WHO and other organizations  of the United Nations  system, 
1. DECIDES  that it shall be the policy of WHO to obtain patents,  inventors'  certificates  or 
interests  in patents or patentable  health technology  developed  through  projects  supported  by 
WHO, where such rights and interests  are necessary  to ensure development  of the new technology. 
The Organization  shall use its patent rights,  and any financial  or other benefits  associated 
therewith,  to promote the development,  production,  and wide availability  of health technology 
in the public interest； 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to report to the seventy-first  session  of the Executive 
Board, to the Thirty-sixth  World Health Assembly  and periodically  thereafter  on the progress 
and the methods of implementation 
well as on consultations  with the of this policy and on any problems  pertaining  thereto,  as 
international  organizations  concerned. Ê
