Agenda item 13.9 24 May 2011 
Cholera: mechanism for control and prevention 
 
The Sixty-fourth World Health Assembly, 
Recalling resolution WHA44.6 on cholera, which led to the establishment of the Global Task 
Force on Cholera Control with the aim of providing  support to Member States in reducing morbidity 
and mortality associated with the disease and in di minishing its social and economic consequences; 
Recognizing that cholera is not being sufficiently  addressed despite its prevalence in epidemic 
form in both endemic and non-endemic areas, causing suffering to millions, particularly among 
vulnerable populations, with a disease burden estim ated to be 3–5 milli on cases and 100 000–130 000 
deaths per year;1 
Reiterating that the spread of cholera is a con sequence of natural disasters, lack of adequate 
supply of safe potable water, deficient sanitation, poor hygiene, contamination of food, unplanned 
human settlement, especially in urban areas, absence of effective health systems, inadequate health 
care, and poverty; 
Acknowledging that effective public health in terventions such as proper and timely case 
management, improved envir onmental management, improved hygiene and sanitation  behaviour,  and 
access and appropriate use of cholera vaccines all de pend on a solid system of surveillance and healthcare delivery and a coordinated programmatic and multisectoral approach th at includes access to 
appropriate health care, clean water and ade quate sanitation, community involvement, open and 
transparent sharing of epidemiological in formation, and sustained policy dialogue; 
Recognizing the importance of emergency prepar edness planning, surveillance strengthening, 
early response, and meeting relevant standards de fined by the work of the Sphere Project in 
emergencies; 
Noting that, in emergency health crises, and in emergencies where the situation threatens 
sanitary conditions, WHO’s work as the humanita rian health cluster lead necessitates close 
cooperation with UNICEF’s responsib ilities as the lead of the “WASH Cluster” (water, sanitation and 
hygiene); 
Affirming that progress in achieving the health -related Millennium Development Goals, and 
particularly access to safe drinking-water and sanitation under Goal 7 (Ensure environmental

2 sustainability), would decrease the occurrence and sp read of cholera, and that improving prevention 
and control of cholera will have a positiv e effect on other diarrhoeal diseases; 
Recognizing that control of cholera is now ente ring a new phase with the development of safe, 
effective and potentially affordable oral cholera vacci nes, and that this approach is complementary to, 
and should not substitute for, the existing effectiv e prevention and control measures that are based on 
improved access to potable water, sanitation and hygiene, 
1. URGES all Member States:1 
(1) to consider health, hygiene, water, sanita tion and environmental issues as integral and 
interrelated parts of development policies and plans, and accordingly to allocate resources and 
undertake action, including health and hygiene ed ucation and public information in order to 
prevent the risks of cholera epidemics occurring or  to diminish these risks, giving due attention 
to the situation and needs of population groups most at risk; 
(2) to strengthen surveillance and reporting of cholera in accordance with the International 
Health Regulations (2005), and e ffectively to integrate surveill ance of cholera into overall 
surveillance systems by building local capaciti es for data collection and analysis and 
encompassing information on crucial determinants  such as water sources, sanitation coverage, 
environmental conditions and cultural practices; 
(3) to work towards mobilizing sufficient tec hnical and financial resources for coordinated 
and multisectoral measures for preparation, prevention and control of cholera, as well as other 
diarrhoeal diseases, in both endemic and epidemic  situations, within the framework of health 
system strengthening and sector-wide approaches, a nd in the spirit of international solidarity; 
(4) to involve the community and to scale up ad vocacy measures in view of the intersectoral 
nature of the disease; 
(5) to refrain from imposing on affected or at-risk countries any trade or travel restrictions 
that cannot be justified on the grounds of public  health concerns, in line with Article 43 of the 
International Health Regulations (2005); 
(6) to undertake planning for and give consider ation to the administration of vaccines, where 
appropriate, in conjunction with other recommende d prevention and control methods and not as 
a substitute for such methods; 
2. REQUESTS the Director-General: 
(1) to strengthen and enhance measures to ensure  that the Organization continues to respond 
expeditiously and effectively to the needs of the countries affected by or at risk of outbreaks of 
cholera; 
(2) to revitalize the Global Task Force on Chol era Control and to strengthen WHO’s work in 
this area, including improved collaboration and coordination among releva nt WHO departments 
and other relevant stakeholders; 
                                                      
1 And, where applicable , regional economic inte gration organizations.   WHA64.15 
 
 
  
 
 
  3  (3) to strengthen the coordination of international assistance during cholera epidemics in 
terms of equipment, human and financial resour ces in order to ensure an effective and quick 
response, and to prioritize close collaboration with  other clusters including, but not limited to, 
the WASH cluster and logistics, in order to maximize the effectiveness of the overall 
multilateral humanitarian response;  
(4) to provide technical support to countries for building their capacity to undertake effective 
control and prevention measures, including surve illance, early warning and response, laboratory 
capacity, risk assessment, case management, data collection and monitoring, and effective 
vaccine deployment; 
(5) to further promote research, and encourag e surveillance, on the emergence of altered 
variants and drug-resistant strains of Vibrio cholerae , as well as to consider safe and effective 
innovations in oral rehydration therapy that can provide additional benefit in treatment outcome; 
(6) to promote ongoing interventions to ch ange behaviour and food and water safety 
measures, including training and advocacy programmes, in order to improve sanitary and 
hygienic practices as critical components of cholera prevention and control; 
(7) to continue to support further research on safe, efficacious and affordable cholera 
vaccines, and to promote transfer of relevant vaccine manufacturing technologies to countries 
affected by or at risk of cholera in order to build capacity for local production of cholera vaccines; 
(8) to develop updated and practical eviden ce-based policy guidelin es, including on the 
feasibility and assessment of the appropriate and co st-effective use of oral cholera vaccines in 
low-income countries and on the definition of target groups; 
(9) to liaise with relevant international fu nding agencies on possible support for introducing 
effective cholera vaccines in low-income countries; 
(10) to report to the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly, through the Executive Board, on the 
global cholera situation and to evaluate efforts made in cholera prevention methods and control.
