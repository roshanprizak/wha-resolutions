GLOBAL STRATEGY  FOR THE PREVENTION  AND CONTROL  OF AIDS ЗОЦЦ  C-> 
The Fortieth  World Health  Assembly, Having considered  the report  of the Director-General  on WHO'S  Special  Programme  on 
AIDS；1 
Deeply concerned  that this disease  caused  by one or more naturally  occurring 
retroviruses  of undetermined  geographical  origin  has assumed  pandemic  proportions  affecting 
all regions  of the world and which represents  a threat  to the attainment  of health  for all; 
Realizing  that the transmission  of AIDS can be prevented,  that information  is an 
essential  element  in all control  of AIDS,  and that every individual  has a responsibility； 
Reiterating  that information  and education  on the modes of transmission  as well as the 
assurance  and use of safe blood and blood products,  and sterile  practices  in invasive 
procedures,  are still the only measures  available  that can limit the further  spread  of AIDS; 
Convinced  of the crucial  importance  of countries  closely  integrating  their programme  for 
the prevention^and  control  of AIDS within  their health  systems  based on primary  health  care; 
Impressed  by the accelerated  response  of WHO to this emergency  during  the past year; 
Noting with satisfaction  that WHO has invested  funds from its regular  1986-1987  budget 
to deal with this serious  public  health  problem  despite  current  financial  constraints; 
Grateful  to all those whose generous  extrabudgetary  contributions  have made it possible 
to give the required  momentum  to WHO's efforts  to combat  AIDS; 
Stressing  the need for substantial  additional  voluntary  contributions  to permit  WHO to 
fulfil its international  directing  and coordinating  role in this field； 
Emphasizing  that all contributing  countries  are protecting  the health  of their own 
people no less than that of others,  since AIDS knows no geographical  boundaries; 
Realizing  that the worldwide  emergency  created  by AIDS will require  urgent  and vigorous 
globally  directed  action  in the development  of epidemiological  surveillance,  the 
intensification  of research  in prevention,  control,  diagnosis  and treatment  including  social 
science  research,  the training  of national  health  workers  and other relevant  areas of 
prevention,  control  and research; 
Recognizing  that due to the relatively  long incubation  period  of the virus and the large 
number of people  already  infected  with it, the worldwide  number  of AIDS cases will continue 
to rise in the next few years irrespective  of public  health  strategies  to prevent  viral 
transmission; 
1. CONFIRMS  that WHO should  continue  to fulfil  its role of directing  and coordinating  the 
global,  urgent  and energetic  fight against  AIDS； 
2. ENDORSES  the establishment  of a Special  Programme  on AIDS and stresses  its high priority; 
3. FURTHER  ENDORSES  the global  strategy  and programme  structure  prepared  by WHO to combat 
AIDS;

preventive  measures  to enable  each person  to protect  himself/herself  from the disease； 
(2) to cooperate  fully with one another  in facing  this worldwide  emergency  within  the
