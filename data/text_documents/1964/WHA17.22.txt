WHA17.22  Report  on the  Development  of the  Malaria  Eradication  Programme 
The Seventeenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the  report  of the  Director-General  on the  development  of the  malaria  eradication 
programme;  1 
Noting  with  satisfaction  that  the  whole  malaria  eradication  campaign  now  covers  over  two-thirds  of 
the world  population  previously  exposed  to the  disease,  that  the  many  millions  living  in areas  in the  attack 
phase  are  already  benefiting  from  a striking  reduction  of malaria  infections,  and  that  there  has  been  an 
appreciable  increase  in the  number  of areas  in the  consolidation  and  maintenance  phases; 
Noting,  however,  that  in a number  of countries,  mainly  in Africa,  where  malaria  endemicity  is high  and 
morbidity  and  mortality  rates  continue  to increase,  it has  not  yet  been  possible  to undertake  malaria 
eradication  programmes,  and  that  in some  of these  countries  pre-eradication  programmes  have  not  even 
been  initiated; 
Noting  further  with  concern  that  in some  malaria  eradication  programmes  the  transmission  of malaria 
persists  in spite  of the  measures  applied,  creating  the  so-called  " problem  areas  ", the  perpetuation  of which 
endangers  the  programmes  and  is resulting  in their  undue  prolongation; 
Noting  also  that,  as malaria  diminishes  or disappears  in certain  areas  during  an eradication  campaign 
or on its completion,  there  is a tendency  for  technical  and  financial  resources  to be prematurely  diverted 
to other  projects,  which  may  prevent  the  true  end-point  from  being  reached  or maintained  and  nullify  all 
the benefits  secured;  and 
Recognizing  that  the  importance  of inter-country  co-ordination  and  the  international  implications  of 
reimportation  of malaria,  particularly  as eradication  programmes  reach  an advanced  stage,  need  to be 
constantly  borne  in mind, 
1. URGES  the  governments  of those  countries  which  cannot  at present  undertake  eradication  programmes 
with  prospects  of success  to make  every  effort  to reach  the  attack  phase  as quickly  as possible,  and  to this 
end to establish  pre-eradication  programmes  including  appropriate  antimalaria  measures  to reduce  mortality 
and morbidity,  particularly  in children; 
2. URGES  the  governments  of countries  with  problem  areas  to undertake  intensive  studies  of the  factors 
responsible  and  to take  such  steps  as may  be necessary  to effect  the  complete  interruption  of transmission, 
including,  where  necessary,  the  setting-up  of special  teams  for  study  and  operations; 
3. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to continue  and  intensify  programmes  of basic  and  applied  research 
and to furnish  the  interested  governments  with  advice  and  technical  assistance  with  a view  to the  early  solution of technical  difficulties  found  in problem  areas  or which  may  exist  in countries  that  have  not  yet  undertaken  malaria  eradication  campaigns; 
4. URGES  governments  and  the  supporting  international  and  bilateral  agencies  to continue  to give  priority 
to the  implementation  and  prosecution  of programmes  leading  to the  earliest  possible  achievement  of malaria 
eradication; 
5. REQUESTS  governments  which  have  eradicated  malaria  in the  whole  or part  of their  territory  to incorporate  the  personnel  of the  eradication  campaign  in the  public  health  services,  thus  retaining  a nucleus  of 
specialists  to assist  in the  vigilance  activities  of the  maintenance  phase  and  in any  emergencies  that  may 
arise; 
6. REITERATES  resolutions  WHA10.32  and  WHA13.55  of the Tenth  and  Thirteenth  World  Health  Assemblies 
relating  to inter-country  co-ordination  and  international  implications  of reimportation  of malaria;  and 
7. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to report  on  the  situation  and  prospects  of the  malaria  eradication 
programme  to the  Eighteenth  World  Health  Assembly.
