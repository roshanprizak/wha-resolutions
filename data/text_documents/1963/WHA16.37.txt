WHA16.37  Smallpox  Eradication  Programme 
The Sixteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on the progress  so far achieved  in the world-wide 
programme  of smallpox  eradication,1 
1. NOTES 
(i) that  smallpox  continues  to be a serious  health  problem  in the endemic  areas,  and  exposes  the rest 
of the world  to risk  of infection; 
(ii) that  the implementation  of many  national  eradication  programmes  is making  slow  progress  owing 
to inadequacy  of national  resources,  particularly  in transport,  equipment,  and  the  potent  and  stable 
vaccine  so necessary  for  tropical  and  sub-tropical  areas; 
2. INVITES  Member  States  to make  voluntary  contributions  in cash  or in kind  to enable  the Organization 
to provide  assistance  to requesting  countries  to meet  their  deficiencies  of transport,  equipment  and  vaccine; 
3. RECOMMENDS  to those  countries  where  the disease  is still  present 
(i) that  they  intensify  their  control  programmes  aiming  at eradication  and  take  the  necessary  steps 
to ensure  the provision  of a potent  and  stable  vaccine; 
(ii) that  neighbouring  countries,  and  particularly  contiguous  ones,  co-ordinate  their  smallpox  control 
activities  and/or  eradication  campaigns  in order  to diminish  the risk  of spread  of the disease  between  their 
respective  territories  during  their  programmes;  and 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General  to submit  a further  report  on the progress  of the smallpox  eradication 
programme  to the Seventeenth  World  Health  Assembly.
