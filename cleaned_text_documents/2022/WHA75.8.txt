Recalling resolutions WHA58.34 (2005) on Ministerial Summit on Health Research acknowledging that high-quality, ethical research and the generation and application of knowledge are critical in achieving internationally agreed health-related development goals, WHA63.21 (2010) outlining WHOs role and responsibilities in health research, WHA66.22 (2013) and WHA69.23 (2016) on the follow-up of the report of the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development: Financing and Coordination, WHA67.20 (2014) on regulatory system strengthening for medical products, WHA67.23 (2014) on health intervention and technology assessment in support of universal health coverage, WHA74.6 (2021) on strengthening local production of medicines and other health technologies to improve access, and WHA74.7 (2021) on strengthening WHO preparedness for and response to health emergencies, which notes the importance of basic and clinical research and recognizes the critical role of international collaboration in research and development, including in multicountry clinical and vaccine trials, as well as rapid diagnostics test and assay development, while acknowledging the need for further rigorous scientific evidence; Noting the recommendations made by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response in their review COVID-19: make it the last pandemic relating to health research and development, including clinical trials; Recognizing that well-designed3 and well-implemented clinical trials are indispensable for assessing the safety and efficacy of health interventions; 1 A clinical trial is defined by WHO as any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes. Clinical trials may also be referred to as interventional trials. Interventions include but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures, radiological procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care changes, preventive care, etc. This definition includes Phase I to Phase IV trials.

For submission to medical product regulatory authorities, trials should adhere to the guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use and some Member States may consider the guidelines of the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities. In order to generate evidence that is sufficiently robust to support decision-making, such as widespread use of therapeutics or preventives, trials should be designed, conducted, analysed and reported appropriately. A well-designed trial must also be practically feasible to conduct. RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS 11 Noting the role of clinical trials in the development of safe and efficacious new health interventions, and in informing associated comparative costeffectiveness evaluations with reference to existing interventions in order to promote the affordability of health products; Noting also that clinical trials of new health interventions are likely to produce the clearest result when carried out in diverse settings, including all major population groups that the intervention is intended to benefit, with a particular focus on under-represented populations; Recognizing the potential benefits available from collaboration, coordination and the exchange of information between public and non-public funders of clinical trials, while actively preventing and managing conflicts of interest, and noting the potential benefits from public and non-public funders of clinical trials taking steps to ensure that funding is targeted towards well-designed and well-implemented clinical trials that will produce actionable evidence regarding health interventions that address public health priorities and in particular the health needs of developing countries, such as neglected tropical diseases, while seeking to strengthen the capability in developing countries to conduct scientifically and ethically sound clinical trials; Recognizing also the essential contribution of participants in clinical trials; Underscoring that clinical trials should be health-needs driven, evidence-based, well-designed and well-implemented and be based on established ethical guidance, including principles of fairness, equity, justice, beneficence and autonomy; and that clinical trials should be considered a shared responsibility; Acknowledging the importance of promoting equity in clinical trial capabilities, by means that include enhancing the core competencies of research personnel, ensuring human subject protections from the risks of clinical trials and acknowledging the shared benefits from the results generated from clinical research and development, including clinical trials, both by strengthening the clinical trial global ecosystem to evaluate health interventions and by working to strengthen country capacities to conduct clinical trials that provide the highest protections to human subjects and meet relevant regulations and internationally harmonized standards by considering: (a) systematic assessment of country-level clinical trial capabilities to promote the ability to conduct rigorous clinical trials compliant with international guidelines and the ability to safeguard human subjects; (b) strengthening of global clinical trial capabilities, in coordination with existing organizations and structures, in order to promote well-designed and well-implemented clinical trials that produce high-quality evidence, and to ensure that trials are designed to reflect the heterogeneity of those who will ultimately use or benefit from the intervention being evaluated and are conducted in diverse settings, including all major population groups that the intervention is intended to benefit, with a particular focus on under-represented populations; (c) where possible, inclusion of all trial stakeholders, including representatives of patient groups, according to best practices in the development of clinical trials with affected communities to ensure that the health interventions address their needs, such as solutions for neglected tropical diseases; (d) inclusion among clinical trial participants of all major population groups that the intervention is intended to benefit; (e) promoting transparent and voluntary sharing, while ensuring information and data security, of both well-designed clinical trial methodologies and the results of clinical trials, including negative results, through open-source methods internationally to enable capability-building in diverse settings; and (f) solid definition and implementation of regulatory measures and other related processes, including those for public health emergencies of international concern; Recognizing that data from clinical trials play an important role in informing cost-effectiveness assessments of new health interventions and their comparison with existing interventions in order to assess their affordability within the context of national health systems, 12 SEVENTY-FIFTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY 1.
