WHA29.67  The  need  for laboratory  animals  (nonhuman  primates)  for the control  of biological  products  and  the 
establishment  of breeding  colonies 
The Twenty-ninth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  WHA28.83; 
Having  considered  the report  of the Director-General  on the need  for laboratory  animals  for the control 
of biological  products  and  the establishment  of breeding  colonies; 
Recognizing  that  there  is an increasing  shortage  of suitable  nonhuman  primates  for biomedical  purposes, 
for both  research  and  the  quality  control  of biological  products,  and  that  this  could  lead  to a lowering  of 
the standards  of safety  of drugs  and  vaccines,  as well  as handicapping  medical  research  in several  disciplines  ； 
Conscious  of the urgent  need  for the Organization  to take  active  steps  to assist  in the improvement  of 
the supply  of nonhuman  primates  for biomedical  purposes  ； 
Believing  that  such  important  problems  can  be solved  only  by international  collaboration  among  all 
countries  concerned  ； 
1. URGES  Member  States  : 
(1) to  strengthen  the  development  of this  resource  in countries  with  wild  populations  of nonhuman 
primates,  with  a view  to promoting  the rational  conservation  and  utilization  of these  animals  considered 
as a renewable  natural  resource  ； 
(2) to  give  increasing  support  for the initiation  and  operation  of nonhuman  primate  production  programmes,  whether  in breeding  stations  or in special  reserves  ； 
(3) to  exchange  breeding  stock  with  other  interested  countries  in order  to establish  a number  of sources 
of each  species  of nonhuman  primate,  thereby  assisting  the conservation  of the animals  in the wild; 
2. REQUESTS  the Director-General  : 
(1) to  encourage  and  facilitate  international  collaboration  where  appropriate  in the development  and 
implementation  of simian  breeding  programmes; 
(2) to  facilitate  the exchange  of both  resources  and  technology  between  all countries  concerned  and, 
with  the  help  of other  interested  international  organizations  as appropriate,  to make  expert  advice 
available  to countries,  at their  request,  on the  conservation,  breeding,  supply  and  utilization  of nonhuman  primates  ； 
(3) to  provide  leadership  in the preparation  of standards,  criteria  and  international  guidelines  on the 
supply  and  use  of nonhuman  primates  for biomedical  purposes; 
(4) to  promote  research  on the possibilities  of replacing  nonhuman  primates  by other  animal  species.
