WHA23.49  Research  on the Organization  of Community  Health  Services 
The Twenty-third  World  Health  Assembly, 
Believing  that  the health  of a community  calls  for a state  of complete  physical,  mental  and  social  wellbeing  and  not merely  the absence  of disease  or infirmity  of individuals  of that  community; 
Emphasizing  that  optimum  development  of the population  structure  requires  environmental  conditions 
which  are favourable  to the health  of all individuals  in the community; 
Considering  that  to secure  the health  of the population  and  its optimum  development  it is necessary  : 
(i) to  assess  the health  status  of the population  and  its development; 
(ii) to assess  and  promote  environmental  conditions  conducive  to health; 
(iii) to devise  methods  and  means  both  for the promotion  of health  of all people  and  the prevention 
of disease,  disability  and  infirmity;  and 
(iv) to organize  facilities  for the prevention  of disease  and  for medical  care  and  rehabilitation  for the 
community  according  to its need; 
Bearing  in mind  that  the proper  organization  and  development  of health  services  for the community 
require  not only  the appropriate  human  resources  and financial  means  but also  continuous  scientific  evaluation 
of the organization  and  activities  of the services  provided;  and 
Believing  that  research  into  the assessment  of health  and  the evaluation  of services  should  be carried  out 
in countries  with  different  social  systems  and  different  levels  of economic  development, 
REQUESTS  the Director-General  to review  the WHO  research  programme  in this  field  so as to ensure  that 
appropriate  priority  is given  to the study  and  development  of the most  appropriate  systems  for the organization  of community  health  services,  and  to report  on this  subject  to the World  Health  Assembly.
