Status of collection of assessed contributions
The Fifty-second World Health Assembly,
Noting with concern that, as at 31 December 1998:
(1) the rate of collection in 1998 of contributions to the eff ective working budget for that year amounted
to 77.94%, leaving US$ 92 373 784 unpaid;
(2) only 105 Members had paid their c ontributions to the effective working budget for that year in full,
and 63 Members had made no payment;
(3) total unpaid contributions in respect of 1998 and prior years exceeded US$ 180 million,
1. EXP RESSES  deep concern at the continuing high level of outstanding contributions, which has had a
deleterious effect on programmes and on the financial situation of the Organization;
2. CALLS THE ATTENTION of all Members to Financial Regulation 5.6, which provides that instalments
of contributions shall be considered as due and payable i n full by the first day of the year to which they relate, and
to the importance of paying contributions as early as possible to enable the Director-General to implement the
budget in an orderly manner;
3. REMINDS  Members that, as a result of the adoption, by resolution WHA41.12, of an incentive scheme
to promote the timel y payment of assessed contributions, those that pay their assessed contributions early in the
year in which they are due will have their contributions payable for a subsequent budget reduced appreciably ,
wherea s Members paying later will see their contributions payable for that subsequent budget reduced onl y
marginally or not at all;
4. URGES Members that are systematically late in the paym ent of their contributions to take immediate steps
to ensure prompt and regular payment;
5. REQUESTS the Director-General an d the Regional Directors to intensify contacts with Member States to
pay their outstanding contributions;WHA52.1
26. REQUESTS  the Director-General to review, taking into account developments in other organizations in
the United  Nations system, current financial arrangements and to propose other possibilities to promote earl y
payments  with a vi ew to ensuring a sound financial basis for programmes, and to report on this matter to th e
Executive Board at its 105th session and to the Fifty-third World Health Assembly;
7. FURTHER REQUESTS the Director-General to draw this resolution to the attention of all Members.
