Agenda item 11.22 21 May 2010 
Strengthening the capacity of governments to 
constructively engage the private sector in 
providing essential health-care services1 
 
The Sixty-third World Health Assembly, 
Having considered the report on strengthening the capacity of governments to constructively 
engage the private sector in providing essential health-care services;2 
Recognizing the variety of private providers , from faith-based and other nongovernmental 
non-profit organizations and individual health-care entr epreneurs, both formal and informal, to private 
for-profit firms and corporations, and the evidence that they play a significant and growing role in 
health-care delivery across the world; 
Noting that governments across the world are faced with the challenge of constructive 
engagement with the complex range of health-care pr oviders, in ways that vary considerably according 
to context; 
Noting that the cost and quality of the care provided and the effect on health and social 
outcomes may vary considerably and that there are serious reasons for concern in environments where 
regulation is poor or absent, yet as a whole the docum entation and evidence base  in this regard is 
weak; 
Recognizing that governments that have the ins titutional capacity to govern the broad range of 
health-care providers can play a constructiv e role in providing essential health services; 
Concerned about evidence that in many count ries effective engagement, oversight and 
regulation of the various private health-care provi ders may be constrained by imperfect strategic 
intelligence, limited financial influe nce and weak institutional capacity; 
Aware that building trust and constructive polic y dialogue are vital for successful engagement, 
oversight and regulation;

benchmarks for strengthened government capacity for constructive engagement with, and oversight of, 
both public and private health-care providers, 
1. URGES Member States: 
(1) to gather, by means that include impr oved information systems and stronger policy 
dialogue processes, the strategic intelligence required for: objectively assessing the positive and 
negative aspects of health-care delivery by private not-for-profit and private for-profit 
providers; identifying appropriate strategies for productive engagement; and developing 
regulatory frameworks that ensure universal access  with social protection and the reorientation 
of service delivery towards people-centred primary care; 
(2) to map and assess, as appropriate, the capacity and the performance of the government 
departments and other bodies concerned with oversight and regulation of both public and 
private health-care provision, including: professi onal councils; institutional purchasers of health 
services, such as public funders and state health  insurance agencies, and accreditation bodies; 
(3) to investigate the potential contribution to the regulation of health-care provision of 
non-health-sector governmental and nongovernme ntal entities, including health-consumer 
protection agencies and patient groups, and, as a ppropriate, set up mechanisms to maximize the 
value of those contributions; 
(4) to build and strengthen for the long term the institutional capacity of these regulatory 
bodies, through adequate and sustai ned funding, staffing, and support;

strengthen the capacity of health ministries and other regulatory agencies in order to improve 
engagement with, and oversight and regulation of, the full range of public and private healthcare providers; 
(2) to convene technical consu ltations, support the research agenda set by Member States and 
facilitate intercountry exchange of experience in  order to obtain better shared understanding and 
documentation of the consequences, positive and ne gative, of the growing diversity of healthcare providers, ensuring that particular attention is given to contexts of poor regulation and to 
consequences in terms of health, health equity, and health systems development; 
(3) also to convene technical consultations , support the research agenda set by Member 
States and facilitate intercountry exchange of experience in order to obtain a better shared 
understanding of the potential of various strategi es to build up the institutional capacity for 
regulation, oversight and harnessing entreprene urial dynamism and s ound cooperation among 
various types of health-care providers;   WHA63.27
