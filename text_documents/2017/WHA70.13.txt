Agenda item 15.8 31 May 20 17 
Prevention of deafness and hearing loss  
The Seventieth  World Health Assembly,  
Having considered the report on prevention of deafness and hearing loss;1 
Recognizing that 360 million people across the world live with disabling hearing loss, a total 
that includes 32 million children and nearly 180 million older adults;  
Acknowledging that nearly 90% of the people with  hearing loss live in low - and middle -income 
countries, which often lack resources and strategies to address hearing loss;  
Concerned by the persistent high prevalence of chronic ear diseases, such as chronic suppurative 
otitis media, which lead to hearing loss and may cause life -threatening complications;  
Acknowledging the significance of work -related, noise -induced hearing loss, in addition to 
issues related to recreational and environmental noise -induced hearing loss;  
Aware that unaddressed hearing loss i s linked with cognitive decline and contributes to the 
burden of depression and dementia, especially in older adults;  
Noting the significant impact of ear diseases and hearing loss on the development, ability to 
communicate, education, livelihood, social w ell-being and economic independence of individuals, as 
well as on communities and countries;  
Aware that most of the causes of hearing loss are avoidable with preventive strategies; that the 
interventions available are both successful and cost -effective; bu t that, despite this, most people with 
ear diseases and hearing loss do not have access to suitable services;  
Recalling resolution WHA48.9 (1995) on prevention of hearing impairment, and resolution 
WHA58.23 (2005) on disability, including prevention, manag ement and rehabilitation;  
Recalling also the World report on disability 2011 , which recommends investment in improved 
access to health services, rehabilitation and assistive technologies and the WHO global disability 
action plan 2014 –2021,2 based on th at report’s recommendations;  
Mindful of the Sustainable Development Goals in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, specifically Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well -being for all at all ages) with

2 its target 3.8 on achieving universal health co verage, which implicitly recognizes the need for persons 
with disabilities to have access to quality health care services, and recognizing that the targets of 
Goal  4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunit ies 
for all) explicitly mention persons with disabilities, and that unaddressed hearing loss greatly hinders 
their education and academic outcomes;  
Appreciating the efforts made by Member States and international partners in recent years to 
prevent hearing  loss, but mindful of the need for further action,  
1. URGES Member States, taking into account their national circumstances:  
(1) to integrate strategies for ear and hearing care within the framework of their primary 
health care systems, under the umbrella of universal health coverage, by such means as raising 
awareness at all levels and building political commitment and intersectoral collaboration;  
(2) to collect high -quality population -based data on ear diseases and hearing loss in order to 
develop evidence -based strategies and policies;  
(3) to establish suitable training programmes for the development of human resources in the 
field of ear and hearing care;  
(4) to ensure the highest possible vaccination coverage against rubella, measles, mumps and 
meningitis,  in line with the immunization targets of the global vaccine action plan 2011 –2020, 
and in accordance with national priorities;  
(5) to develop, implement and monitor screening programmes for early identification of ear 
diseases, such as chronic suppurative  otitis media and hearing loss in high -risk populations, 
including infants, young children, older adults and people exposed to noise in occupational and 
recreational settings;  
(6) to improve access to affordable, cost -effective, high -quality, assistive hea ring 
technologies and products, including hearing aids, cochlear implants and other assistive devices, 
as part of universal health coverage, taking into account the delivery capacity of health care 
systems in an equitable and sustainable manner;  
(7) to dev elop and implement regulations for the control of noise in occupational settings, at 
entertainment venues and through personal audio systems, as well as for the control of ototoxic 
medicines;  
(8) to improve access to a variety of ways of communicating thro ugh promoting alternative 
methods of communication, such as sign language and captioning;  
(9) to work towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives 
and promote well -being for all at all ages) and Goal 4 (Ensure inclusive an d equitable quality 
education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all) in the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development, with special reference to people with hearing loss;    WHA 70.13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  3 2. REQUESTS the Director -General:  
(1) to prepare a world report on ear and h earing care, based on the best -available scientific 
evidence;  
(2) to develop a toolkit as well as provide the necessary technical support for Member States 
in collecting data, planning national strategies for ear and hearing care, specifying how 
prevention  of hearing loss can be integrated in to other health care programmes, raising 
awareness, screening for hearing loss and ear diseases, and organizing training in and provision 
of assistive technologies;  
(3) to intensify collaboration with all stakeholders w ith the aim of reducing hearing loss due 
to recreational exposure to noise through the development and promotion of safe -listening 
standards, screening protocols, software applications to promote safe -listening and information 
products;
