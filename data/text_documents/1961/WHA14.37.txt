WHA14.37 Continued  Assistance  to Newly  Independent  States 
The Fourteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Recognizing  that  there  is an increasing  number  of new  Members  from  under-developed  areas  being 
admitted  to full  membership  of WHO;  and 
Realizing  that  without  adequate  numbers  of trained  doctors,  nurses,  technical  and  allied  health 
personnel  among  the  indigenous  population,  these  new  States  can  never  hope  to achieve  the  primary 
objective  of WHOâ€”the  enjoyment  of the highest  attainable  standard  of health, 
1. NOTES  with  satisfaction  the speedy  assistance  given  by WHO  to the Republic  of the Congo  (Leopoldville)  along  these  lines;  and 
2. REQUESTS  the  Director-General 
(1) to  continue  to give  such  speedy  assistance  to all newly  independent  States  which  become  Members 
of WHO;  and 
(2) to  report  on these  matters  to the twenty-eighth  session  of the Executive  Board  and  to the Fifteenth 
World  Health  Assembly. 
Handb.  Res.,  5th ed.,  6.2 Eleventh  plenary  meeting,  22 February  1961  (section  2 
of the fourth  report  of the Committee  on  Programme 
and Budget)
