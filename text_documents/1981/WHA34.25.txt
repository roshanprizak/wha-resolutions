INTERNATIONAL  DRINKING  WATER SUPPLY  AND SANITATION  DECADE 
The Thirty-fourth  World Health  Assembly, 
Having considered  the report^-  of the Director-General  relating  to the International 
Drinking  Water Supply  and Sanitation  Decade  (1981-1990)； 
Stressing  that the provision  of safe drinking  water 
the essential  elements  of primary  health  care, and one of 
Health for All; and sanitation  services  is one of 
the essential  global  targets  for 
Noting with concern  that progress  made in the 1970s in improving  drinking  water and 
sanitation  services  was slower  than expected； 
Considering  that wide acceptance  by Member  States  of the International  Drinking  Water 
Supply and Sanitation  Decade  offers  a new incentive  to provide  people  with these essential 
services  ； and that maximum  use should  be made of all opportunities  afforded  by the Decade 
to promote  the attainment  of Health  for All； 
Recognizing  the need to monitor  specific  measurable  indicators  of the impact  on health 
of improved  water supplies  and sanitation  developed  during  the Decade,  so as to help mobilize 
the substantial  necessary  resources,  foster  community  participation  and further  encourage 
international  support  for that programme； 
Aware that the Decade  presents  an opportunity  to eliminate  dracunculiasis  (Guinea  worm 
disease)  as a public  health  problem  in affected  areas,  where the prevalence  of the disease 
could serve as a uniquely  visible  and measurable  indicator  of progress  for the Decade； 
Restating  the principles^  endorsed  by the Thirty-third  World Health  Assembly  that Decade 
efforts  will contribute  to Health  for All through： 
and programmes； 
self-sustaining -complementarity  of sanitation  with water supply  development  ； 
-focus  on both rural and urban underserved  populations  in policies 
-achievement  of full coverage  through  replicable,  self-reliant  and 
programmes； 
-use of socially  relevant  systems  applying  an appropriate  technology； 
-association  of the community  with all stages  of programmes  and projects  ； 
-close  relation  of water supply  and sanitation  programmes  with those in other sectors； 
-association  of water supply  and sanitation  with other health  programmes； 世界術生大會决議  —^i^o^i*^)〉
