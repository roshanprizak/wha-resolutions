FORTY-FOURTH  WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY WHA44.8 
Agenda item 17.2 13  May 1991 
TUBERCULOSIS  CONTROL  PROGRAMME 
The Forty-fourth  World Health Assembly, 
Recalling  resolution  WHA36.30; 
Having considered  the Director-General‘s  report on the tuberculosis  control 
programme； 
Expressing  concern  that three million  tuberculosis  deaths and eight million  new 
cases continue  to occur annually  in the world; 
Noting with concern  that the current  strategy  for tuberculosis  control  has begun to 
lose its effectiveness  in the industrialized  countries,  and that in these countries  the 
declining  trend of incidence  has either slowed down or been reversed; 
Recognizing  that in many developing  countries  tuberculosis  is decreasing  little if 
at all owing to the constraints  on effective  application  of programme  policies  for 
tuberculosis  control,  and that in some countries  the disease  is rapidly  increasing  owing 
to the AIDS epidemic； 
Further recognizing  nevertheless  that the goal of tuberculosis  control  programmes  in 
developing  countries  can be achieved  by resourceful  application  of existing  technology 
even under very difficult  conditions,  as demonstrated  in several  countries  on a national 
scale; 
1. URGES  Member States to give high priority  to intensifying  tuberculosis  control  as an 
integral part of primary  health care, reviewing  the situation  of current  control 
activities,  particularly  in the light of the HIV pandemic,  introducing  short-course 
chemotherapy,  and improving  the treatment  management  system; 
2. ENDORSES  the dual approach  of action and research  adopted  by the programme  as the 
best means of achieving  a reduction  in tuberculosis  mortality  and morbidity; 
3. ENCOURAGES  international  and bilateral  agencies  and nongovernmental  organizations  to 
continue to help control  tuberculosis  by collaborating  with, and providing  support  to, 
the programme； 
4. REQUESTS  the Director-General: 
(1) to intensify  collaboration  with Member States in strengthening  national  control 
programmes  in order to improve  case-finding  and treatment  and attain a global target 
of cure of 85% sputum-positive  patients  under treatment  and detection  of 70% of 
cases by the year 2000, taking care to ensure that these programmes  are integrated 
as far as possible  into primary  health care activities； 
(2) to focus and strengthen  the tuberculosis  control  and research  strategy  for the 
1990s with a view to: 
(a) elaborating  and implementing  WHO's strategy  for tuberculosis  control  in 
order to achieve  the global target; 
(b) promoting  as far as possible  the integration  of tuberculosis  control  into 
primary health care； 
(c) promoting  global interest  in research  on all aspects  of tuberculosis 
control and elimination  and undertaking  sharply  focused  research  activities 
that are likely to produce  new knowledge  and technology  to overcome  critical 
constraints  including  biological  and psychosocial  aspects  for the control  and 
elimination  of this disease； 
(d) increasing  the participation  of international  and bilateral  agencies  and 
nongovernmental  organizations  and providing  international  direction  and 
coordination  to combat tuberculosis,  for example  through  a coordination 
committee  or an advisory  and review group； 
(3) to continue  to seek the extrabudgetary  resources  required  to support  these 
activities； 
(4) to report to the World Health Assembly  through  the Executive  Board on the 
progress  made in the implementation  of the tuberculosis  control  programme.
