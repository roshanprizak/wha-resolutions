WHA26.61  Long-term  planning  of international  cooperation  in cancer  research 
The Twenty-sixth  World  Health  Assembly, 
In view  of the exceptional  importance  for national  and  international  health  of cancer  as a major  cause 
of mortality  and  of morbidity  in many  countries  ； 
Recognizing  that  work  on cancer  absorbs  a substantial  and  increasing  part  of the financial  and  other 
resources  of Member  States  and  of their  research  institutions,  and  that  in some  countries  cancer  patients 
absorb  a high  proportion  of the treatment  facilities  ； 
Realizing  that  the problems  of cancer  are extremely  complex  and  are  unlikely  to be fully  elucidated  by 
any one  country  or by the uncoordinated  efforts  of many  countries  ； 
Conscious  of the  ever-increasing  possibilities  for  international  cooperation,  both  governmental  and 
nongovernmental,  in the study  of the causes  and  mechanisms  of malignant  disease  and  in the development 
of programmes  for  its treatment  and  prevention  ； 
Believing  that  such  coordinated  international  action  is essential  if the elucidation  of the problems  associated  with  cancer  is to be accelerated, 
1. CONSIDERS 
(1) that  the  main  effort  in cancer  research  should  be made  by the  national  research  organizations  of 
Member  States,  but  that  their  activities  should  be coordinated  and  uniform  methodology  should  be 
used  wherever  possible;  and 
(2) that  such  coordination  can  best  be achieved  through  an integrated,  comprehensive  programme 
to which  institutions  of Member  States  may  adhere  to the extent  that  they  so desire,  and  which  would 
cover,  inter  alia,  the  standardization  of methods  and  of terminology,  epidemiological  studies,  and  the 
development  of methods  for  the early  diagnosis  and  treatment  of cancer  and  of preventive  measures, 
including  the identification  and  removal  of carcinogens  from  the environment; 
2. BELIEVES  that,  under  the  leadership  of the  World  Health  Organization,  A broad  international  programme  should  be designed  in cooperation  with  the  International  Agency  for  Research  on Cancer,  the 
International  Union  against  Cancer  and  other  interested  international  bodies,  in accordance  with  their 
constitutions  and  in pursuance  of resolution  WHA25.60;  and  that  the  components  of the  comprehensive 
programme  should  be regularly  reviewed  in the light  of the progress  achieved  ； 
3. DEEMS  it necessary  to develop,  for each  recommended  line  of research: 
(1) a central  record  of the  more  promising  studies  being  carried  out,  along  with  concrete  proposals 
for research  and  methodology; 
(2) a list of reference  centres  and  collaborating  institutions  ； 
(3) a computer-based  information  service  which,  inter  alia,  would  collect  and  disseminate  data  on 
the results  of ongoing  studies  and  on relevant  new  developments  in medicine,  biology  and  other  sciences; 
and 
4. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  : 
(1) to convene,  if it is possible  to do so without  drawing  on the  regular  budgets  for 1973  and  1974, 
a meeting  of experts,  of representatives  of Member  States  and  of the  nongovernmental  organizations 
concerned,  to make  recommendations  for a long-term  programme  for international  cooperation  in the 
field of cancer;  and 
(2) to prepare,  on the  basis  of these  recommendations,  a programme  for  international  cooperation, 
and submit  it to the Twenty-seventh  World  Health  Assembly.
