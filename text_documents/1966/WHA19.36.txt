WHA19.36 Prevention  of Traflic  Accidents' 
The Nineteenth  World  Health  Assembly, 
Believing  that  an important  task  of health  administrations  is the  protection  of people  against  health 
hazards  of every  kind  ; 
Having  in mind  the  heavy  losses  resulting  from  the ever-increasing  number  of traffic  accidents; 
Believing  that  further  research  is required,  on an international  basis,  to elucidate  the  role,  already 
demonstrated  by scientific  work,  of human  and  medical  factors  in traffic  accidents;  and 
Noting  with  satisfaction  the  steps  already  taken  by WHO  to inform  Member  States  of the  importance 
of this  problem, 
1. REQUESTS  the  Director-General  to consider  the  possibilities  of WHO  playing  a more  active  role  in the 
prevention  of traffic  accidents,  with  special  emphasis  on the  human  and  medical  aspects  of the  problem 
and on the  co-ordination  of international  research  in this  field;  and 
2. FURTHER  REQUESTS  the Director-General  to inform  the  Executive  Board  and  the  Assembly  of the amount 
of additional  annual  expenditure  that  would  be entailed  in giving  effect  to the possibilities  referred  to in the 
previous  paragraph.
